<h1>Long Forks</h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
First, I would like to thank Mishigne for showing me that forks 
are possible. I think he was the first Turtle I ever saw use long forks.
Most of the info I use originally came from him, and some from
Rem4rk and Chill. I can't share all of it but I want to thank these three 
players for what little I know.
<p>
A long fork is a shot 2 that comes together at the moment it 
hits the enemy. You get full damage without keeping 
the shot in the air 2.5 seconds. A fork's airtime is similar to 
the timebomb SS, but it's a little shorter. 
It's probably 2 seconds or maybe a hair less.

This is different from a shot 2 that barely comes together after about
2.3 seconds. That's called a fake fork (or spoon). That's just a normal 
shot 2.

Like the SS, the secret to forks is lots of work and memorization.
Calculating forks is a lot of work and is mostly done to show off.
You almost never HAVE to fork unless you're on very flat land and 
just can't get a decent shooting angle. 
So forks are for players who already have a pretty good 
idea how to do Timebomb SSes. I would not recommend learning forks
until you can do everything else in this guide. 
<p>
Most of the fork info I'm going to show is based on hitting your fork with 
the final (fifth) crossing of shot 2. It's also possible to hit with earlier spins but mostly 
your shot will be easiest if you use the final spin. I give some extra 
info anyway if have the time to memorize the other forks.
<p>
Calculating forks works like calculating Timebomb SS:<br>
<b>1. Find the 0 wind angle and power.<br>
2. Adjust for elevation.<br>
3. Adjust for wind.<br>
4. Shoot.<br>
</b>
<p>
To get the 0 wind angle and power, just look to see what landmarks the enemy 
is closest to. As before, I have info for a 6 part split and an 8 part split. Because
forks are very precise and very sensitive to power, I will be giving exact powers 
rather than rounding up or down. Try to be as close as you can in power.
<p>

If you want to try hitting on an earlier spin, here's some info:

<tr><td>25</td><td>2.2</td><td>2/3 SD</td></tr>
<tr class="type2"><td>17</td><td>3.15</td><td>1.0 SD</td></tr>
</table>

Other fun forks:<br>
56, 1.1 (hits 1/6 SD) - this is good when you're just a bit too far for 1 spin or<br>
even 2 spin forks. I find it's a very easy and flexible fork for distances like this.<br>
10, 3.95 (hits 1 SD) - a 1 screen stunt shot.<br>
30, 3.15 (hits 1.5 SD) - Very stunty long fork.<br>
23 3.95 (hits 2 SD) - WTF :D
<p>
Elevation adjustment for forks is difficult because so much depends on whether 
you're shooting under angle 45 or over 45. The good news is that in most cases, 
you can be one angle off and sometimes even 2 angles off and still 
make a decent fork.
<p>
What I'd recommend doing with forks is to use the timebomb elevation adjustment,
but adjust a little bit more for forks. Maybe 1 or 2 angles more. I can't be more precise 
than that because it's too much work, but if someone 
wants to calculate elevation and send me the info I'll be glad to share it.
<p>
<h2>Windcharts</h2>
Here are the fork windcharts for half screen and 1 screen.
By now you should be able to read these so I won't use a lot of 
space explaining.

Some fork advice: Hitting on your first try is difficult. But you should almost always 
be able to hit on your 2nd try if you can understand how your first shot failed.
If your first shot misses because the shot didn't have enough time 
to come together:
<ul>
<li>If the angle is over 45, then add a little power, and use a higher angle if the 
shot travelled the correct distance. Usually you only need to add 2 or 3 angles 
and .1 bars of power or so.
<li> If the angle is under 45, then you must again use a higher angle, but this 
time you reduce power. I'll explain why in the next section. Again no more than
2 or 3 angles, and .1 bars of power. 
</ul>
If your shot misses because it's in the air too long (fifth 'crossing' happens
somewhere in front of enemy):
<ul>
<li>If the angle is over 45, reduce power a bit (.1 or less) and lower 2-3 angles.
<li>If the angle is under 45, lower 2-3 angles and add some power. In some cases,
just adding power is enough.
</ul>
If the shot's 'spin' is correct but crosses somewhere behind them, and your 
shooting angle is over 45, then simply raise angle. You may also wan to use
1 or 2 pixels less power, but using the exact same power should be ok.
If the shot's spin is correct but lands in front of them, you need to 
lower your angle and then use the same power (or 1 or 2 pixels more).
For angles under 45, if the shot flies over their head, but crosses at
the correct place, simply lower your angle and don't touch the power.
If the shot hits the ground below them, then raise angle and use the same power.
<p>
Remember that 1 angle change when forking means almost nothing. If you're 
going to fix your fork, you need to adjust at least 2, and often 3 angles.
Also remember that the adjustment gets larger when you're dealing with wind, 
especially opposite or down wind. Angle adjustment also gets larger when 
dealing with elevation and wind. For example in opposite wind, I might 
adjust my angle twice as much for elevation as usual. This is a matter of feel 
unless you want to take the time to grind out the numbers and make 
a table.
<p>
Lastly, some people calculate forks a different way, and you may find you 
like this way better. If you want to try it, here's
