<body>hi, this is a rather complete guide on trico 3-in-1...<br>
<br>
ok first thing u need to know is the power levels for shooting from different directions and different distances...in 0 wind of course...with all 3 cabbages hitting the target.. look below...<br>
<br>
From RIGHT to LEFT<br>
1/4 sd- angle 40, power 1.0<br>
1/2 sd- angle 66, power 2.05<br>
1/2 sd- angle 81, power 3.2<br>
3/4 sd- angle 55, power 2.25<br>
3/4 sd- angle 76, power 3.2<br>
full sd- angle 44, power 2.5<br>
full sd- angle 71, power 3.2<br>
<br>
From LEFT to RIGHT<br>
1/4 sd- angle 68, power 1.45<br>
1/2 sd- angle 50, power 1.7<br>
1/2 sd- angle 76, power 2.55<br>
1/2 sd- angle 84, power 3.9<br>
3/4 sd- angle 68, power 2.6<br>
3/4 sd- angle 77, power 3.2<br>
full sd- angle 60, power 2.7<br>
full sd- angle 77, power 3.85<br>
<br>
ok and now we move on to the important part Very Happy , knowing how to adjust for wind<br>
<br>
below there is 2 wind charts which i drew in microsoft powerpoint den pasted in paint Embarassed , one for higher angles above 50, one for lower angles below 50<br>
<br>
before u see the charts....<br>
MUST READ THIS - MANUAL ON USING THE WIND CHART<br>
the red numbers are the wind factors, used for calculating the angles for compensation, for example, if it states +0.5, it means u adjust the angle by (plus wind X factor)<br>
<br>
the numbers below the red ones are the adjustments for power<br>
for example, if it says 6W+0.1, it means u add 0.1 power for EVERY 6 wind, which means if the wind is 6, u add 0.1, if the wind is 12, u add 0.2 and so on.<br>
<br>
ok now examine it carefully Razz<br>
<br>

<br>
and the second one, with slight differences<br>
<br>
<img src="icytalent2.jpg"><br>
<br>
these wind charts r fairly accurate in my opinion although i usually use feel to adjust, unless i really HAVE to hit Very Happy<br>
<br>
<br>
OK NOW I WILL GIVE AN EXAMPLE SITUATION TO SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS<br>
<br>
-the target is exactly one screen away on the right of you<br>
the wind is 18 directly pointing against you<br>
-so first u find out the power and angle for 0 wind, for this case lets use angle 60 with 2.7 power<br>
-to adjust angle - determine the chart to use, for this case we use high angle chart<br>
-the chart says -0.4, so we multiply 18 by 0.4, which gives 7.2, we round off to 7, so the angle to use is angle 53<br>
-to adjust power - determine the chart to use, for this case use high angle chart<br>
-the chart says 6W+0.1, so we increase 0.3 in power, because 18 wind = 3 X 6 wind, so the power to use is 3.0<br>
<br>
-therefore for this situation, u use angle 53 with 3.0 power to hit the target<br>
<br>
Comments from your opponents if u do it correctly - "omg wtf pro", "dam aimbot", "ahhhh i quit this game"<br>
haha just a joke lolz Very Happy<br>
Laughing<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
here we come to the end<br>
<br>
i might update this guide with more pictures soon<br>
<br>
ok done!!!!!!!!!! lolz im still learning so dont blame me if u miss Laughing<br>
