<body>abit = a bit, some. But I've also seen it used jokingly, like if you dual every shot someone might say 'dual abit plz', or if your shot is waaaay off "miss abit onli"<br>
act pro = try too hard to look like a pro even when you're not, usually said after a dumb dual that missed.<br>
angmoh = white guy, can be used to be a little insulting.<br>
blur = dumb, not aware of what's happening. "don't act blur I see u botting!"<br>
can... anot = can (this be done) or can't it? "my dual kill him can anot?"<br>
CB = chee bye, which means cunt (you don't need to use ***'s lol).<br>
CCB = more or less the same thing, but a bit stronger.<br>
CBF = can't be fucked... used like 'can't be bothered'. "I CBF go to shop, I just wear gold armor in avatar off".<br>
dun = don't<br>
FFS = for fuck's sake, you see british people and a few americans use it too. "ffs why y u didn't kill the wand first"<br>
heng = lucky/luckily (sometimes you also see 'heng ar')<br>
haiz = boring<br>
gwai lo = roundeye, white guy. This might be more chinese or hong kong than singapore, but I see it sometimes.<br>
KNN = ka ni na, fuck your mother, but usually not used as in insult. It's more like "goddammit", you say it after you miss.<br>
"knn y I miss that ez shot"<br>
KNS = ka ni sai, fuck your sister, usually used as an insult :P "kns why you ruin my angle"<br>
Lan Jiao (LJ) = cock<br>
SG = singapore (singaporeans use this for both shotgun and singapore sometimes). "SG?" = "you're from singapore?"<br>
SMLJ = si mi lan jiao, "what the cock?!" ... sort of singlish way of saying 'what the fuck!' in an annoyed way<br>
sianz (siaaanzzzzzZZZzZ) = booooooring<br>
sianzsational = sarcasm for 'sensational'. Maybe only my friend uses this one.<br>
1 / one = added at the end of some sentences to indicate a specific person or thing, like "you shoot him can 1?" doesn't mean use shot 1, it's just added to the end of the line. "he's so stupid 1"<br>
           = second meaning: want ... for example 'dun 1 to play anymore.'<br>
si bei (si bei pro) = act (act pro). If you try a hard shot through a tornado to an enemy 2 screens away someone might say "si bei pro lol"<br>
tml = tomolo, same as 'tomorrow'<br>
tt = that<br>
lai = wait<br>
lar, lor, leh, ler, lah, la, etc = added to the end of a sentence to emphasize something, like adding "see?" at the end of a sentence in english, or maybe a bit like adding "hey" before.<br>
lidat = like that. "y shoot me lidat", "lidat oso can"<br>
like that oso can = "you can do that (or do it that way) too." Sort of used jokingly, like if I meant to dual shot 2, but accidentally pick shot 1 and get lucky and kill them anyway, someone might say "lidat oso can"<br>
ngl/ngle = angle<br>
wad = what. "for wad u dual, tt guy almost dead."<br>
xjj = xiao jiao jiao, like saying "small wee wee"... little cock. A fun insult.
