Bonjour/Hi/Hola/Guten Tag/Hej/Ciao/Alo,<br>
<br>
You might have noticed the very short guide. This is because there's actually not that much to write on Bigfoot, but since every bot needs a guide, even the bot dubbed the "newb bot/mobile/car", here's a short one that will teach you how to be a good Bigfoot. Well, as good as you can be on a Bigfoot. It's also a basic guide, since my knowledge of Bigfoot is more limited than Raon. The oldies might remember my old Raon Guide, well I have a surprise for you :D<br>
---<br>
<br>
1. Shots/Mobile<br>
<br>
Shot 1(Missiles, Bombs)<br>
Damage : 180-200<br>
Angle : 20, 10 True Angle<br>
Delay : 780<br>
Projectiles : 4<br>
<br>
The shot you probably will use most of the game. It does good damage, so you can probably outdelay people with bots like Boomer while dealing only ~50 damage less than them. It's also useful for digging holes, and then more holes. And tunnels. Yeah. To bunge, just aim a little foward of them. They may or may not stay on a little ledge with the hole beneath them depending of how you aimed, so don't blame me.<br>
---<br>
<br>
Shot 2(Paintbucket Shotgun, Beercan Shotgun)<br>
Damage : 150-310<br>
Angle : 20, 10 True Angle<br>
Delay : 780<br>
Projectiles : 6<br>
<br>
The other shot you will probably use. This one used to be a good bunger, but Softnyx nerfed it so it falls lined, which isn't good if you want to bunge something. Why the wild damage differences? Why can't you hit 310 even if you hit all the 6 beercans in? I'll explain all of that in section 2.<br>
---<br>
<br>
SS(Yamato Cannon, Tomato Launcher)<br>
Damage : 350-400<br>
Angle : 10, all True<br>
Delay : 1300<br>
Projectiles : 12<br>
<br>
Teehee. Never use that for bunging, else I might smack you. I don't know why, but I've never managed to bunge anything with that, so it's not a good bunger</logic>. It's the Bigfoot finishing shot, unless you want to have 100 more delay from a shot 1 dual. Let's assume you don't. Oh, and it's more potent long range than the other shots. I'll explain why later.<br>
---<br>
<br>
Bigfoot<br>
Health : 1000<br>
Defence : 0.5/5(Super Noob Chicken)<br>
Power : 3/5(Medium)<br>
Bunge : 4/5(Pro)<br>
Movement : 5/5(Aimbot)<br>
Climbing : 2/5(Chicken)<br>
---<br>
<br>
2. Nasty Bigfoot Tricks<br>
<br>
I won't explain the bases of bigfoot like bunging, angle flattening or raping. I'm sure you will find by yourself.<br>
...<br>
Ok, maybe not. Here's some quick explications.<br>
<br>
Bunging = Shoot at little less than at the feet of your target.<br>
Flattening = Done long range. Just shoot, and you'll demolish any angle the opponent first had.<br>
Raping = Done the same way as bunging.<br>
<br>
2a. Tunnel<br>
<br>
Yes! The tunnel! We all know this crap. But it's pretty useful in things like Tag. Bigfoot is especially good at tunnelling, because his shots drills through land like blood and...I'll think of something later. Anyway, there's is two ways to tunnel. And now, CODE ART IS BACK!(that was the surprise)<br>
<br>
2aa. Tag Tunnel<br>
<br>
Step 1 : Dig a hole.<br>
<br>
CODE<br>
   [  ]=                 (   )()<br>
   o o                    V V<br>

         '       '<br>
         '_______'<br>
   <br>
<br>
<br>
Step 2 : Dig towards your enemy.<br>
<br>
CODE<br>
                         (   )()<br>
                          V V<br>
----------         ------------------------<br>
         '       '<br>
         '       '<br>
         '       '<br>
         '       '''''''''<br>
         '    [  ]=  <br>
         '____o o_________<br>
                 <br>
<br>
<br>
Step 3 : Get under, tag to a tracer bot or Nak.<br>
<br>
CODE<br>
                          o<br>
<br>
<br>
   <br>
                         (   )()<br>
                          V V<br>
----------         ------------------------<br>
         '       '<br>
         '       '<br>
         '       '<br>
         '       ''''''''''''''''''''<br>
         '              (==)_  <br>
         '_______________--_________<br>
                 <br>
<br>
<br>
Shoot. Womg, 500 damage and the enemy can't even retaliate if he's a total idiot and didn't dig a tunnel coming for you earlier. Which rox, BTW.<br>
<br>
2ab. Hole From Hell<br>
<br>
Repeat step 1 and 2. Instead of tagging, dig an hole under your enemy so he gets bunged(make sure you immobilised him first). Dig from under, bunge, win.<br>
---<br>
<br>
2b. Japan Attack(or Kamikazi, whatever)<br>
<br>
This is a particularly nasty attack with Bigfoot because it hurts. It has to be done with shot 2. Dual and weather(any besides Thunder) is recommended.<br>
<br>
Step 1 : Stick your cannon inside a body(any, besides your allies)<br>
<br>
CODE<br>

No sexual innueno please.<br>
<br>
Step 2 : Tap the shoot button.<br>
<br>
Step 3 : Win.<br>
<br>
Bam. 310 damage single-shot, around 600 dualed. It pwns even more with something like Thor. It can be done with any bot, but it's super nasty with Bigfoot.<br>
---<br>
<br>
2c. Trapdoors(AKA oh noes you raped my angle without me even spawning)<br>
<br>
Step 1 : Dual. dualsmile04.gif <---<br>
<br>
Step 2 : Dig an hole where an enemy would spawn.<br>
<br>
CODE<br>
              \/<br>

            '     '<br>
            '_____'<br>
<br>
<br>
Step 3 : Wait for the spawn.<br>
<br>
Step 4 : Win.<br>
<br>
2d. Bigfoot and SS long range raping.<br>
<br>
SS is the Bigfoot's oddball. It can be used long range, because the missiles split to form something like that :<br>
<br>
CODE<br>
              o       o<br>
             o       o<br>
            o       o<br>
           o       o<br>
          o       o<br>
         o       o<br>
           <br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, less angled, less lined up, but still good. I get you : "how the hell can this help?" Well, suppose you have two enemies bunched up. You shoot them long range. They land like this.<br>
<br>
CODE<br>
              o       o<br>
             o       o<br>
            o       o<br>
           o       o<br>
          o       o<br>
         o       o<br>
       [  ]=    [  ]=<br>
       o o      o o  <br>
<br>
<br>
I guess you can deduct that you're winnar.<br>
<br>
3. The dreaded "one-turn bunge" on Adiumroot<br>
<br>
My knowledge is pretty limited because I'm an idiot, so I know of only one way to do it. Which will be explained in(you guessed it) code art.<br>
<br>
Step 1 : Dual. dualevil01.gif <--<br>
<br>
Step 2 : Make sure Thor is on and away from your enemy. thor02.gif <--<br>
<br>
Step 3 : Shoot like imaged. Win.<br>
<br>
CODE<br>
* = thor destroys this<br>
                        (  )<<br>
                         <br>
<br>
<br>

If anybody wants the original ASCII file created by me for ALL the bots, simple enough so they fit tightly in a guide, PM me. I'll be more than glad to give you the file if you want to use it for a guide(not the guild X) ) or whatever. Less simple than this, more like my Cakebot's JD.<br>
