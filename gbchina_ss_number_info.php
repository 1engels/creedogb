<body>hi, a few corrections:<br>
1. from "Real Name" on (including "Real Name") are all optional information, you don't have to put in anything if you dun wanna<br>
<br>
2. id numbers in china have upgraded to 18 digits, though 15-digit id numbers also can be used, in gunbound this is for finding lost passwords<br>
<br>
here's something for making fake 15-digit id numbers (might be real ;))<br>
the first 6 digits are your city and the area where you were born (those 6 digits can be divided further down, but i'm not going to) the next 6 digits are your birthdate (yymmdd), the last three i'm not sure what they are (i think it's for distiguishing same birthplace, same birthdate ppl), though i know that if it's a even number it says the person is female and odd is male<br>
<br>
3. and the "Province Share" is a bad translation, it just means the province that you are in<br><br>
