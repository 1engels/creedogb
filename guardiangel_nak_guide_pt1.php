<body>nak guide (beginner stage)(public guide) by guardiangel <br>
it has been troubling me for a long time that i dun wanna share any info about nak... <br>
for a long long time =.= and... been kinda lazy and stuff... and i realise that... <br>
i m suking... due to that "stress" i made for myself whether to post a guide... so <br>
YES i will post my guide and here it is... <br>
<p>
beginner's version part 1.... intermediate advanced and pro will be slowly updated into <br>
the hidden guides forum <br>
<p>
chapter 1 <br>
melee battles <br>
<p>
nak is a very good bot for close range... that most people know.... but i have witnessed <br>
alot of mistakes in close range... people use 10-20 Ngle... which is a mistake.. a very <br>
bad 1... what ur trying to do when u do melee shots... when u dual... is to get BOTH shots <br>
to land on the SAME spot as close to each other as possible.... low Ngles will cause it to <br>
go further apart... melee is ez when winds are AGAINST u... but what if they are pointing <br>
toward the enemy? then u have a problem.... <br>
<p>
when wind is pointing against enemy and lets say ur above him by alittle... change ur <br>
shooting mode to DRAG... dual and leave abit of space... and just click ur mouse,.. <br>
thats the most effective rather than gambling whether u can walk all the way to the <br>
OTHER side where the wind is against and shoot or even suicide urself with him <br>
<p>
when u are having melee battles... its best to stay above... or below the enemy... if <br>
ur at the same lvl... u are at a disadvantage... nak is NOT armor... u must let the ball <br>
SLIDE to the opponent... NOT hit him with it.... <br>
<p>
nak can be said to be the hardest bot... its harder than trico coz u have formulas for<br>
trico... but the only formula that exist for nak is full power or alittle of 1/2 screens <br>
of here and there... and what if land heights are different? melee is a good way for nak <br>
to SAVE UR TEAM and not cause ur team to lose... when ur a nak... u realise that EVERY of <br>
ur shot counts... ur miss could cause bad land in ur future shots... ur enemy's misses <br>
might also contribute to the down turn of the game... <br>
<p>
Chapter 2 <br>
Things u should know <br>
<p>
Creedo contributed to a nak guide in GB HL blah blah forums on nak... which is not <br>
true which i would like to state the facts... sometimes hwen u shoot underground... <br>
it explodes... y? do not point ur arrow at a sharp point... alwaes point it INTO a <br>
concave curve... if it still explodes... its GIS's bug... not ur fault... =) <br>
according to creedo its coz u dun add enuff power... i shotgun once underground and <br>
that happened... 4 bars ^^ could u teach me how to reach 5 bars? =) <br>
(Creedo's note, not written by guardianangel: pfft that's not what I said but anyhow :D)<br>
<p>
my favourite Ngle is Ngle 30 which is also the default given Ngle for nak... its the <br>
most useful Ngle in game... Ngle 30 from many parts of metamine can hit many corners <br>
and send snipers in an impossible situation... slowly drain away their turns by <br>
makeing Ngle then finally bunging them when they are at the corners... <br>
<p>
another thing i get alot of questions about is shot 1 and SS... YES they ARE the same.. <br>
when SS is going down... it SEEMS faster so people think its heavier... well its not... <br>
same weight... shot 2 is the same where it lands... its just how the curve goes... <br>
<p>
<p>
Chapter 3 <br>
Know ur shots... <br>
<p>
one of the most important part of nak is knowing ur shots... firstly like what i posted <br>
in many nak threats... u must know where ur land will land and where it will hit... its <br>
the 2 main factors... its just like trico... thats y i say trico is not harder than nak...<br>
firstly u must know where it will LAND... then u must know HOW MUCH it will DIG... <br>
and what Ngle will it go up at... how FAR will it go... this all depends on the wind <br>
and the Ngle and power u use... <br>
YES wind DOES affect ur underground shots but not as much as above the ground... <br>
<p>
for tornadoes... its more complicated i will explain in detail in the next few stages <br>
of the guide... the basic stuff u neeed to know is... if u shoot underground... <br>
it will pass through the tornado without being affected.... while above it will be <br>
affected... <br>
<p>
knowing ur shots comes from constant practice... they way how i did it was is tarted <br>
off with Ngle 30... then slowly 40 50 60 70 45 55 ...then slowly after time u will <br>
know how the curve goes.... <br>
<p>
MUST KNOWS for nak... 1 screen for nak shot 2 = 79 <br>
1 screen for nak shot 1 = 76 <br>
BJSL Ngle 70shot 2 1/2 screen is about 2.1 full screen is about 3 <br>
<p>
next stage is intermediate... <br>
covering high Ngles <br>
underground <br>
up down shots <br>
<p>
oops just another thing... lord is up for recuiting... and its back.. <br>
i'll be trailing for nak and trico <br>
AOG will be trailing for armor mage turtle raon (if hes lazy give him _|_ this) <br>
acespades will be trailing for boomer (he also wants to trail for every gay bot u <br>
can think off) will make a threat specifically for trail rules and everything else =)<br>
