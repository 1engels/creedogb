A quick note on damage, delay, etc: 
Damage is based on how clean your hit is, and whether or not your shot was 
partially blocked by dirt.  The damages I give are based on a solid center hit 
vs a mobile with average defense.  In some conditions your shot
will do more or less.  I'd say your best shot 1 will be 180 dmg and a great
shot 2 will do 320.  If you are lucky and have the right position, Turtle can get more damage
out of his 1 and 2 by doing "turtlekaze", which means positioning your cannon deep inside
the enemy's body so that your shot hits their core directly. A shot 2 turtlekaze, done perfectly,
can get 400-450 damage BUT Turtle will also do 200-250 damage to himself, so it's not always worth it.
<p>
Delay increases based on how long you take to shoot. For every second
you take to shoot, the delay for your shot  will have 12 points added.
All the other bots only have 10 points added but Turtle gets 12 because turtles are slow.
Don't worry about that fact, it's meaningless 99% of the time.
So, if you fired an SS with no delay it uses 1290 'time units'.  If you used 3 seconds to 
fire the shot, you are now using 1290+36 time units, so that's 1326 time units. 
Most items also add to your delay.  
If you use a dual+ item with Turtle's shot 1, you are adding 250 delay to your 
natural delay of 740.  Dual+ is therefore 990 delay as long as you use shot 1 
first.  That means dual+ delay is only 100 more than using a normal shot 2. 
There's a myth some players spread that doing shot 2 first gives better damage.
This is a lie.  Use 1 first.    
<p>
Some tips to increase the damage of your shots:
<ul>
<li>High angle shots automatically get a damage bonus. A high angle
is considered 70 or above. I think that if any part of your shot passes
above angle 70, even if your actual shooting angle is lower, you
can get the high angle bonus. It also has to stay airborne at least 
2 seconds. The damage increase is 25%.
<li>Make use of weather like lightning, force, and Thor.
<li>The closer your shot can hit to the center of the enemy's body,
the more damage the shot will do. This sweet spot is called the
enemy's 'core'. When you 'core' a shot, you hit for maximum damage.
There are different ways to get this damage. The best
way, if you're lucky, is to shotgun into the enemy's "belly" from
below them. If that's not possible, the next best shot is a high angle
that hits their back a little bit bit past center. Hitting dead center is good too.
Whenever you get a hit on the enemy, pay attention to how it hit and how much damage you got.
If you think you can do better, then on your next shot try walking
a few pixels forward or back to make the next shot land
exactly where you want for the best damage.
</ul>
I'd say for high defense mobiles 250+ is good damage to try for.
If your target has average defense then a good shot will do about 280.
Against weak mobiles like boomer, grub, and JD you can get 300.
