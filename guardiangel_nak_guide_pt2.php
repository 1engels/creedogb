<br>
chapter 4 <br>
high Ngles<br>
<br>
<img src="nak_guide_nice_far_range.gif"><br>
<br>
high Ngle is the thing that makes people go WOW PRO ! ! ! ! <br>
well high Ngle is mostly full power... <br>
but y full power while other bots use 2 bar or 3 bar high Ngle? <br>
the thing is about dig... its good to practice and know how much it <br>
digs and blah blah blah.... high Ngling is very helpful as of the enemy <br>
hiding under a cliff it still can dig down and hit him... <br>
<br>
<img src="nak_guide_not_bad.gif"><br>
<br>
high Ngle also minimizes the chances of the shot hitting a pixel... <br>
in the earlier chapters... u remember that i stated that... when u dual <br>
with shot 2... u have to try to make both shots explode as closely together... <br>
that only means higher Ngle... and the most effective way of getting the highest <br>
Ngle possible is to full power.... full power i suggest between 85-79 is good enuff... <br>
below 85 u can use BLSJ or just pure feeling... feeling isn't hard... just needs <br>
constant practice... an example of a nice high Ngle... <br>
<br>
<img src="nak_guide_take_that_shyt_600_dmg.gif"><br>
<br>
the shot i have shown as an example has medium wind... in high Ngle... <br>
wind is highly a problem... i wun reveal any wind charts... ^^ sowwie~~~ u can <br>
use armor wind guides which can almost be accurate but might be a difference in.... <br>
2-3 Ngles in high wind... mayb 1 or 2 in medium... <br>
<br>
during high Ngles... distance of dig depends highly on the Ngle it enters the ground... <br>
ok... when u use high Ngle lets say Ngle 81... and wind is going against u... <br>
first thing... when its going down... it will be going down on minus 81 degrees... <br>
due to wind it might be brought down to minus 84 degrees... all depending on the <br>
strength of wind... and when it enters the ground at minus 84 degrees.. it will come <br>
up at 84 degrees... which MEANS it lands nearer to u and explodes nearer than it <br>
should have too... just explaining rather than u guys just shoot blindly... when <br>
land conditions turn bad... these facts will be the major factor of ur nak's survival... <br>
<br>
high Ngles u should know for metamine... exactly 1/2 of metamine map is 81 degrees... <br>
full screen is 79 <br>
85 is alittle less than 1/2 screen <br>
<br>
chapter 5 underground shots <br>
underground shots are very weird and hard to feel when u just started nak... <br>
underground is the super power of nak... the most lethal weapon of nak... <br>
underground shots are one of the hardest a nak could experience... especially when ur in <br>
a difficult position or a boomer dualed into the ground a missed... leaving a nice nak <br>
home for u... <br>
when u go into a deep hole and do an underground shot... ALWAES and ALWAES prepare to <br>
come OUT... make sure u can make an Ngle for urself to high Ngle any time the enemy <br>
spoils ur land to hit him...... <br>
there are many types of underground shots... and many methods too... each method needs <br>
a different kind of power control... the method in this method is "stick to wall" <br>
method... means u go close to the land and ur butt is close to the wall... try to <br>
shoot into a concave curve and never aim at pointed edges which will cause a tk due <br>
to explosion on contact... <br>
<br>
under ground... at different heights... is much harder... first imagine the curve... <br>
then just think that ur target is at ur height... ... if ur shot can reach the point <br>
at ur height... it should most likely hit ur target.... <br>
<br>
<img src="nak_guide_far_underground.gif"><br>
<br>
near range stick to the wall underground shots can be simple... but make sure <br>
that atleast .5 cm of the power bar is used or the shot might not hook <br>
onto the wall <br>
<br>
chapter 6 <br>
up down shots <br>
<br>
when u learn up down shots... u have reached about the middle of all u need to learn <br>
to be... good =) <br>
up down shots will apply to atleast winds 10 and up against u... most up down shots <br>
are near 180 degree winds... during these winds... u have to know alot of stuff... <br>
firstly u need to have a good sense of feel for shot 1... because in this stage... <br>
no formulas will work... this section will only guide u how to do them... at 20 winds... <br>
at 1/2 screen distance to 1 screen distance use Ngle 60... at 20 winds below 1/2 screen <br>
use Ngle 70... learn to use these 2 Ngles... read the chapter on high Ngle and it will <br>
explain on how it works... i can only provide u examples of the shots <br>
