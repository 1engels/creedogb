<body>It is raining now, and lightning keeps on striking my router, forcing me to quit<br>
the game with inukiM and other GBA dudes. For this reason, + I'm kind of free, I<br>
will translate the Shen Pu (knat) 's Trico 3 in 1 guide for you guys. <br>
<p>
I haven't really tested his method, because it seems harder than DarkSword <br>
(knat) 's method which I have been using for a long time. Anyway, the original <br>

<p>
There are two shooting methods in GB which have been widely used by the users <br>
since long time ago due to their simplicity and effectiveness, i.e. <br>
<p>
1. Fixed power method (Adjust angle, e.g. Half toss, full power, etc.) <br>
2. Fixed angle method (Adjust power, e.g. Mage-60, boomer-89, etc.) <br>
<p>
Fixed angle method is harder than fixed power method, users need to memorize the <br>
'distance-power' table and they need to calculate the power due to affection of <br>
resulting wind force, but anyway, to most pros, this method is considered easy, <br>
it takes only two steps. <br>
<p>
Both of the methods above are the mainstream methods in GB, based on them, alot <br>
of new methods are born. But, a new calculation is born because of the emergence <br>
of trico (and its users) i.e. Fixed timing method (Adjust power and angle). <br>
<p>
Technically, this method is far more difficult than both mentioned methods, <br>
however, a player still need both of the methods as basis of mastering Fixed <br>
timing method. <br>
<p>
Let's stop crapping and get into the topic, i.e. Trico's 3 in 1 calculation. <br>
<p>
Alot of players might think that the miraculous 3 in 1 shot is done due to <br>
luckiness, which actually is based on certain principles. After spending my time<br>
on research, I found out the principles, and through these princpiles, I come <br>
out with calculations, which are the the steps below: <br>
<p>
1. Apply the base power. Which is the power (under 0 wind condition) for <br>
hitting 3 in 1 when both users are on the same horizon. <br>
<p>
Left->Right: 1.5 ; 2.6 ; 3.6 ; 4.6 <br>
Right->Left: 0.9 ; 2.2 ; 3.2 ; 4.2 <br>
<p>
(Note: 4.2 and 4.6 are used on tail or vertical wind) <br>
<p>
I suggest you all to practice the power above in some 0 wind stages. <br>
<p>
2. Calculate the shooting power <br>
<p>
Power needs to readjust due to the wind affection. Here are two principles to <br>
remember: <br>
<p>
a. Tail/Up wind: Reduce power <br>
b. Opposite/Down wind: Add power <br>
<p>
The exact data: <br>
<p>
a. Upward vertical wind: For each 2 wind power, reduce 0.05 power. <br>
b. Tail wind (horizontal): For each 5 wind power, reduce 0.05 power. <br>
c. Downward vertical wind: For each 2 wind power, add 0.05 power. <br>
d. Opposite wind (horizontal): For each 5 wind power, add 0.05 power. <br>
<p>
You can deduce the power to change for other winds from the data above. <br>
<p>
Another thing to consider it the horizontal line, for most cases, when target <br>
is located about 2 mobiles height above you, add 0.05 power; if the target is <br>
lower than you for about 2 mobiles height, reduce 0.05 power. <br>
<p>
3. Deduce screen distance from shooting power <br>
<p>
After knowing the power to use, you have to calculate the angle. The first <br>
step in calculating angle is to get the screen distance. The data below are <br>
screen distances for different shooting powers, I tested them with <br>
=ShangHai=HongHong (knat) , thanks for his wonderful effort. <br>
<p>
2.0 power: 24.0(h) <br>
2.1 power: 22.0(h) <br>
2.2 power: 20.0(h) <br>
2.3 power: 18.0(h) <br>
2.4 power: 16.0(h) 50.0(f) <br>
2.5 power: 14.0(h) 40.0(f) <br>
2.6 power: 13.0(h) 30.0(f) <br>
2.7 power: 12.0(h) 28.0(f) <br>
2.8 power: 11.0(h) 26.0(f) <br>
2.9 power: 10.5(h) 24.0(f) <br>
3.0 power: 10.0(h) 22.0(f) <br>
3.1 power: 9.5(h) 20.0(f) <br>
3.2 power: 9.0(h) 18.0(f) <br>
3.3 power: 8.5(h) 17.0(f) <br>
3.4 power: 8.0(h) 16.0(f) <br>
3.5 power: 7.5(h) 15.0(f) <br>
3.6 power: 7.5(h) 14.0(f) <br>
3.7 power: 7.0(h) 13.5(f) <br>
3.8 power: 6.5(h) 13.0(f) <br>
3.9 power: 6.5(h) 12.5(f) <br>
4.0 power: 6.0(h) 12.1(f) <br>
<p>
The definition of 1 full screen distance is quite ambiguous, some say from left <br>
edge to right edge, some say from the left edge of "Esc" button to the right <br>
edge of "F8" button; But anyway, if I were not wrong, Shen Pu's 1 full screen <br>
definition is the latter one I mentioned just now. <br>
<p>
To apply the data above, let's say you are using 3.2 power, 90 - (9.0) = hitting <br>
half screen, 90 - (18.0) = hitting one screen. <br>
<p>
4. Deduce target distance from screen distance <br>
<p>
For this step, it's quite simple, but to make it accurate you need alot of <br>
experience. The way I calculate distance is to use the object in screen to <br>
calculate. For instance, if enemy is located right after "All"button, and half <br>
screen distance = 14 angle, then, your target distance will be 0.5*14 = 7. <br>
<p>
5. Calculate angle to compensate with wind <br>
<p>
For those who's good in Half Toss, it might not a big problem for you, because <br>
the wind chart is almost the same. <br>
<p>
http://www.geocities.com/yuenqe/HalfToss.Wind.Chart.txt<br>
<p>
This is the wind chart of Half Toss, the wind factor works for shooting power <br>
around 3.0. For most of the cases it might just work fine; for 2.0 power, the <br>
result you get might have to be reduced by 2; for 2.5 power, the result has to <br>
be reduced by 1. Again, practice and learn from experience. <br>
<p>
6. Collecting all the data and shoot <br>
<p>
The formula is: <br>
<p>
Angle: 90 - (target distance = step 4) + half toss angle (- for opposite wind <br>
direction = step 5) <br>
Power: The result of step 2 <br>
<p>
And you will see 3 cabbages draw beautiful curves in the sky and all 3 hit the <br>
enemy in 1. As if you miss, it might still be 3 in 1 but hitting the ground. <br>
<p>
What I can say is.. Formula can only be a way to help you to gain experience, <br>
to be more accurate and perfect in shooting, what you have to do is practice <br>
again and again. I have been asking Koreans for some tips and what they told me <br>
is: "Just practice more and more." I think this is the ultimate "guide" of pros. <br>
Remember, this is always true: "Practice makes perfect." <br>

[QUOTE]1. Apply the base power. Which is the power (under 0 wind condition) for <br>
hitting 3 in 1 when both users are on the same horizon. <br>
<p>
Left->Right: 1.5 ; 2.6 ; 3.6 ; 4.6 <br>
Right->Left: 0.9 ; 2.2 ; 3.2 ; 4.2 <br>
<p>
(Note: 4.2 and 4.6 are used on tail or vertical wind)[/QUOTE]<br>
<p>
For shenpu's 3in1 aiming formula, you must calculate the power to use first, then follow up <br>
by calculating the angle.  When you use the power levels described above, you will get a <br>
3in1 vs an enemy who is roughly level with you, as long as the shot isn't being affected <br>
by wind... and as long as you choose the correct angle.<br>
Your goal should be to use the lowest power level you possibly can.  For example, <br>
shooting --> you want to use 1.5 if the enemy is close enough to hit with it (first spin).  <br>
If they're too far away to hit with 1.5 bars of power, you want to switch to 2.6 bars <br>
(which is enough power to keep the shot in the air long enough for 2 spins).  This <br>
power is good for over half a screen, probably close to 1 full screen distance.  <br>
However you will sometimes have wind fightning your shot so even 2.6 bars of power <br>
isn't enough to hit a faraway target.  You must then switch to 3.6 bars of power, <br>
with the goal being to hit on the 3rd rotation of your shot instead of the 2nd.  <br>
The 4.6 obviously is not possible in 0 wind conditions, and is just another way of <br>
saying that if the wind is blowing your shot upwards and keeping it airborne for <br>
a long time, sometimes you can get 4 complete spins by shooting with full power.  <br>
Hitting an enemy with this is sorta lucky and showing off, 3.6 bars is enough power <br>
for most situations.<br>
<p>
So to review: The first step of the calculation is to know the power levels listed.  <br>
Decide which power level you think can travel far enough to hit the enemy, <br>
but don't use more power than you need to... if you can hit them on the first spin, <br>
that's easier than hitting them on the 2nd spin, etc.<br>
<p>
Next step:<br>
[quote]<br>
2. Calculate the shooting power <br>
<p>
Power needs to readjust due to the wind affection. Here are two principles to <br>
remember: <br>
<p>
a. Tail/Up wind: Reduce power <br>
b. Opposite/Down wind: Add power <br>
<p>
The exact data: <br>
<p>
a. Upward vertical wind: For each 2 wind power, reduce 0.05 power. <br>
b. Tail wind (horizontal): For each 5 wind power, reduce 0.05 power. <br>
c. Downward vertical wind: For each 2 wind power, add 0.05 power. <br>
d. Opposite wind (horizontal): For each 5 wind power, add 0.05 power. <br>
<p>
You can deduce the power to change for other winds from the data above. <br>
<p>
Another thing to consider it the horizontal line, for most cases, when target <br>
is located about 2 mobiles height above you, add 0.05 power; if the target is <br>
lower than you for about 2 mobiles height, reduce 0.05 power. <br>
[/quote]<br>
<p>
So once you have chosen your basic power, how to deal with wind?  If there's no wind, you <br>
don't want to change your power usually... the power levels listed are just right for 0 <br>
wind.  If the wind is pointing up, you need to reduce power by 1/20th of a bar for every <br>
2 wind strength pointing up.  If the wind is pointing down, you just do the opposite and <br>
add 1/20th of a bar.  So if the wind is pointing 10 straight down, add 5/20th's of a bar <br>
(which translates to 1/4th bar).  If wind is 18 down, add 9/20th's of a bar (just a bit <br>
less than half a bar).  Basically use less power if wind is blowing upwards because the <br>
wind will keep the shot airborne long enough for your 3in1.  Use more power if the wind <br>
is pointing downward, otherwise the basic power levels listed earlier won't be enough, <br>
the shot will underspin and land flat.  <br>
<p>
For wind that is pointing left or right, you will add or subtract power based on whether <br>
the wind is helping your shot or holding it back.  He recommends adding 1/20th for every <br>
5 wind, or reducing 1/20th for every 5 wind.  That means that the most you'll ever adjust<br>
your power (in the strongest wind, 26) is by about 5/20th's... i.e. 1/4th of a bar.  <br>
<p>
Lastly, he is mentioning that if the enemy is above or below you, power needs to change.  <br>
For 2 mobile heights higher than you, add 1/20th of a bar of power to your shot, and if <br>
the enemy is 2 mobile heights below you, subtract the same amount.<br>
<p>
So all the math in part 1 and 2 means you should have the correct power for a 3in1 as long <br>
as you factored in the following things<br>
*Is the power level you chose enough to reach the enemy, <br>
especially if the enemy is far away?<br>
*Did you add or reduce power based on the wind?  He gives formulas for four different wind <br>
directions, but of course there are many wind directions and you'll need to probably make <br>
some guesses based on wind that is somewhere between up/down/left/right.  <br>
*Did you add or reduce power a bit for enemies who are not level with you?  <br>
Even on metamine you will have to make shots vs enemies who are a bit above or below you.<br>
<p>
If you did all of this, you have the power for a 3in1, and you must commit to using <br>
this exact power level.  All you need to do now is calculate the angle.  <br>
<p>
[quote]<br>
3. Deduce screen distance from shooting power <br>
<p>
After knowing the power to use, you have to calculate the angle. The first <br>
step in calculating angle is to get the screen distance. The data below are <br>
screen distances for different shooting powers, I tested them with <br>
=ShangHai=HongHong (knat) , thanks for his wonderful effort. <br>
<p>
2.0 power: 24.0(h) <br>
2.1 power: 22.0(h) <br>
2.2 power: 20.0(h) <br>
2.3 power: 18.0(h) <br>
2.4 power: 16.0(h) 50.0(f) <br>
2.5 power: 14.0(h) 40.0(f) <br>
2.6 power: 13.0(h) 30.0(f) <br>
2.7 power: 12.0(h) 28.0(f) <br>
2.8 power: 11.0(h) 26.0(f) <br>
2.9 power: 10.5(h) 24.0(f) <br>
3.0 power: 10.0(h) 22.0(f) <br>
3.1 power: 9.5(h) 20.0(f) <br>
3.2 power: 9.0(h) 18.0(f) <br>
3.3 power: 8.5(h) 17.0(f) <br>
3.4 power: 8.0(h) 16.0(f) <br>
3.5 power: 7.5(h) 15.0(f) <br>
3.6 power: 7.5(h) 14.0(f) <br>
3.7 power: 7.0(h) 13.5(f) <br>
3.8 power: 6.5(h) 13.0(f) <br>
3.9 power: 6.5(h) 12.5(f) <br>
4.0 power: 6.0(h) 12.1(f) <br>
<p>
The definition of 1 full screen distance is quite ambiguous, some say from left <br>
edge to right edge, some say from the left edge of "Esc" button to the right <br>
edge of "F8" button; But anyway, if I were not wrong, Shen Pu's 1 full screen <br>
definition is the latter one I mentioned just now. <br>
<p>
To apply the data above, let's say you are using 3.2 power, 90 - (9.0) = hitting <br>
half screen, 90 - (18.0) = hitting one screen.<br>
[/quote]<br>
<p>
This chart is listing various power levels you might have come up with as a result of steps <br>
1 and 2.  Take the power level you decided to use (on the left half of the chart), and <br>
the chart will give you clues about what angle to use to hit 1/2 screen and 1 full <br>
screen away.   You must think in terms of how many 'angles' distance the enemy is <br>
from you.  For example, if you've played boomer or cake, you know that an enemy who <br>
is pretty close to you can be hit with angle 89, full power.  That enemy is 1 angle <br>
distance from you.  If you needed to use angle 88 to hit him, that means the enemy is <br>
2 angles away... 87 means the enemy is 3 angles away... and so on.  1 full screen <br>
distance is 9 angles away, which means using angle 81.<br>
<p>
If you understand all that, then you will get this chart.  Let's say you decide you need <br>
to use 2.7 bars of power.  That means (according to the chart) that if you start at angle <br>
90, you need to lower 12 angles to hit an enemy half a screen away.. and 28 angles to hit <br>
an enemy all the away at the other end of the screen.<br>
The more power you use, the less you have to adjust your angle to hit enemies further away.<br>
<p>
Just in case it isn't tricky enough yet, the translator says ShenPu's definition of 1 <br>
full screen is about from the left edge of the "Esc" button to the right edge of the "F8" <br>
button.  That means he considers 1 screen to be a little bit less than what a lot of <br>
players consider 1 full screen.  <br>
<p>
[quote]4. Deduce target distance from screen distance <br>
<p>
For this step, it's quite simple, but to make it accurate you need alot of <br>
experience. The way I calculate distance is to use the object in screen to <br>
calculate. For instance, if enemy is located right after "All"button, and half <br>
screen distance = 14 angle, then, your target distance will be 0.5*14 = 7. [/quote]<br>
<p>
This is pretty straightforward, it means you can measure the enemy's distance using <br>
certain parts of your screen.  A boomer or cake player should know, for example, <br>
that the distance from your all/teamtalk button to the half power mark on your power <br>
meter measures EXACTLY 1/3 of a screen.  Trico can use similar tricks to measure.  <br>

compensate with wind <br>
[/quote]<br>
<p>
Oof! Here's the tricky part.  Once you've chosen your power and angle, you must then do <br>
even MORE math to adjust your angle to compensate for wind.  The power/angle chart listed <br>
in step 3 is for 0 wind.  You might be thinking "but I thought I already adjusted for <br>
wind in step 2, by adding or reducing a bit of power"... that power adjustment merely <br>
guaranteed you got the correct SPIN out of your shot!  The power adjustment isn't to <br>
make your shot land in a different location! Remember, location is controlled by angle.   <br>
If wind is blowing 20 against you, and you'd normally want to use angle 85 to hit the <br>
enemy... it doesn't matter how much power you try to add, any power you use <br>
(including full power) will fly backwards.  Therefore the ONLY way to deal with wind <br>
is to adjust your angle.  Changing your angle = changing where the shot lands.  <br>
So ... you're gonna need to remember the wind adjustment for 2 or 3 different wind <br>
charts.  Sounds hard?  Well what the hell, you already memorized all the stuff <br>
from steps 1-4.  What's one more thing.  If you're familiar with fixed power <br>
shooting already, you should have memorized <br>
[url=http://media.virtuafighter.com/media/gb/WindChart.jpg]<br>
the wind chart for approx. 2.4 bars of power[/url].  So you really only need to <br>
understand that for less power, you adjust by fewer angles, and for more power <br>
you must make larger angle adjustments.<br>
<p>
[quote]he formula is: <br>
<p>
Angle: 90 - (target distance = step 4) + half toss angle (- for opposite wind <br>
direction = step 5) <br>
Power: The result of step 2 <br>
<p>
And you will see 3 cabbages draw beautiful curves in the sky and all 3 hit the <br>
enemy in 1. As if you miss, it might still be 3 in 1 but hitting the ground. <br>
<p>
What I can say is.. Formula can only be a way to help you to gain experience, <br>
to be more accurate and perfect in shooting, what you have to do is practice <br>
again and again. I have been asking Koreans for some tips and what they told me <br>
is: "Just practice more and more." I think this is the ultimate "guide" of pros. <br>
Remember, this is always true: "Practice makes perfect." <br>
[/quote]<br>
<p>
So basically what this is doing is summarizing all the math you did to come up with a 3in1.<br>
<p>
To decide power:<br>
*Start with the basic 0 wind powers listed in step 1<br>
*Adjust power a bit for the wind, so your shot doesn't overspin or underspin<br>
*Also add or reduce power a bit for enemies who are above or below you.<br>
<p>
To decide angle:<br>
*Start with the angle you'd decide in to use in 0 wind according to the chart: look at the <br>
power level you want to use, then you can see how many angles to adjust to hit 1/2 a <br>
screen away and 1 screen away.  For enemies that are not at these precise points, you <br>
can use common sense.  If you've decided to use 3 bars of power, the chart says lowering <br>
10 angles (from 90) will hit half a screen away.  If the enemy is a little bit closer <br>
than half a screen, you need only lower 9 angles.  A little further than half a screen, <br>
lower 11, etc.<br>
<p>
*Use helpful in-game measurement tricks (or make a cheatsheet/ruler) to help you figure <br>
out the enemy's distance... so you can more accurately come up with the right angle <br>
needed to hit them.<br>
<p>
*Adjust your angle based on the wind's strength and direction.  <br>
Use my homemade windchart as a starting point, and just remember you need to adjust <br>
LESS for lower power and MORE for high power.<br>
<p>
-----------<br>
<p>
When you do all these steps you will have an exact angle and an exact power.<br>
If your math is good (well, if shenpu's math is good) then you will hit the enemy <br>
with a nice 3in1.<br>
<p>
<p>
Here's an example shot following the formula:<br>
<p>
You're shooting --> <br>
Enemy is half a screen away from you (and let's say they're perfectly level with you, <br>
not above or below).<br>
Wind is blowing against you at 5 strength.<br>
<p>
First: You must decide from the left to right shot powers listed which is best for <br>
this situation.  The powers listed are:<br>
[i]1.5 ; 2.6 ; 3.6 ; 4.6[/i]<br>
Using common sense, you should know that an enemy who is a half screen away cannot <br>
be hit using just 1.5 bars of power.  So you decide to use 2.6 bars of power.<br>
<p>
Second: It says that for wind that is blowing against you, you must add power.  <br>
This is to guarantee your shot doesn't spin too much or too little.  Specifically it says: <br>
[i]For each 5 wind power, add 0.05 power. [/i]<br>
Since the wind is 5 against, we add exactly .05 power (1/20th of a bar).<br>
So the power level will now be 2.65, not 2.6.  If it helps, 2.66 would be 2 and 2/3rds <br>
of a bar.  So for now, 2 and 2/3rds is what we'll memorize to keep it easy.<br>
<p>
Third: We must decide the angle we'd use (in 0 wind) with this power level.<br>
According to the chart, for 2.6 bars of power:<br>
[i]2.6 power: 13.0(h) 30.0(f)[/i]<br>
<p>
That means at 2.6 bars of power, you can hit an enemy half a screen away by lowering <br>
13.0 angles (always start at angle 90, then lower).  So 90-13 angles = angle 77.  <br>
The thing is, will 77 be ok?  We're using 2.65 bars of power, not 2.6... <br>
so maybe 77 will cause the shot to fly too far by a little bit.  <br>
I'm coming up to that part in a second.<br>
<p>
Next step: You must change your angle to adjust for the wind.  <br>
It happens that we're using 2.6 bars of power, and my windchart is based around 2.4 <br>
bars of power.  Using the formula from my windchart should be good enough.  <br>
That formula says that for weak wind blowing against you, you lower your angle by <br>
(Wind/2) degrees.  So if this wind is blowing 5 against us, 5/2 =2.5 ... HMM.  <br>
There's a decision to make.  You can't lower 2.5 angles, you can lower either 2 or 3.  <br>
Which to choose?  Well remember how I was saying earlier than because we're using 2.65 <br>
bars of power, the shot might fly a little far and land behind the enemy?  <br>
Because I'm aware of that potential problem, I'm going to decide to lower only 2 angles.  <br>
I'm already worried that the shot was going to fly too far, and if I decide to lower <br>
3 angles the chances are good it will do exactly that.  So I'm going to lower 2 angles... <br>
from 77 to 75.<br>
<p>
The final answer is to use 2.65 bars of power at angle 75.<br>
Does the math work out?  Well you can double check it in a game, but there's another way <br>
to double check it... let's see what mauvecow says: <br>
[i]- Half screen, 2nd spin: 77 degrees, 2.65 power.[/i]<br>
<p>
Woot, remember that we lowered 2 angles to compensate for wind, so if this were a 0 <br>
wind shot, the angle and power would indeed by 77, 2.65 bars.  <br>
If both mauvecow and shenpu come up with the same angle/power, it must be solid.<br>
<p>
I hope this cleared it up.<br>
