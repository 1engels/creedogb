<h1>Using shot 1</h1>       
<hr>
<blockquote>
Turtle's shot 1 is weak, but there are a lot of situations where
it's better than 2:
<p>
<h2>Weakening or killing:</h2>
If the enemy has less than 150 HP, a shot 1 will kill them
and uses less delay than a shot 2. That lower delay might
be helpful later in the game. It's also safer because 1 makes a bigger
explosion when it misses than shot 2 does, so if the enemy
is barely alive, a near miss can still splash them for
a little bit of damage and kill them, while a near miss shot 2
wouldn't hurt them at all. Also remember that a full hit from shot 1
will do better damage than a half-hit from shot 2.
<p>
Shot 1 also can be used to set up a kill.
In theory, almost any enemy can be killed with 2 duals. 
But in reality you will see that some bots have high defense and
your dual doesn't do the 'expected' 500+ damage.
If your dual takes off less than half their life, then
you probably need both a dual and an extra shot 1
to kill them. It doesn't matter whether whether
the dual comes first or the shot 1 (in terms
of damage), but it's good strategy to use shot 1 first.
An enemy with more than half his life thinks
"My turn's coming, should I dual or not? Since I have
so much life left, I won't dual yet. I'll probably get another
shot before I die." If you use a dual on an enemy who is thinking
like this, he may change his mind and say "Now I'm almost dead.
I'd better dual so I do lots of damage before I die."
But if you use the shot 1 first, the enemy may not realize
he's about to die because he still sees he has "about" half his life left.
You're also guaranteeing that if you screw up, you at least
don't use up a ton of delay and give the enemy 2 shots in a row
against you.
<p>
<h2>Beating the enemy's delay:</h2> At the opening of a match, if the
enemy uses a fast shot 2, then you may not be able to beat their
delay with your own shot 2... but a shot 1 will work.
A lot of players understand delay in these simple terms at
the beginning of the match, but later in the match there will be chances
to win delay as well. If you haven't already, click the button that shows
the "Turn list". It's the little curved arrow at the top left of your status bar.
<p>
Watch the delay numbers for the enemies below you on this list. If any
of those enemies show a delay of 800 or higher, then you can use
a shot 1 and get another turn before that player can shoot again.
(The same idea can be used with shot 2, but you need to look for
delay higher than about 900). In most situations, if there's a chance
to beat the enemy's delay, you should take it. The exception is when
an enemy needs 1 more dual to kill, and you have a guaranteed shot
on them. In those cases, just kill the enemy, don't waste a turn
beating their delay if you know you can kill them right now.
<p>
Also, be aware that when most bots fire a dual at the start of the match
(or any time their delay is about even with yours)... they are giving a huge
delay advantage. The delay advantage is so big, you actually have
time to fire two fast shot 1's, and then still get another turn before
the enemy can shoot again. If all your shots hit nicely, you can do
about 900 damage to them before they get another turn.
<p>
<h2>Dealing with no angle:</h2> If you're on fairly flat land and
cannot get a good shooting angle for shot 2, then just use shot 1.
Eventually you'll probably get angle (either by walking to the nearest 
slope or by the enemy breaking some land near you).
<p>

<p>
<h2>Creating angle:</h2> Sometimes the nearest slope is so
far away, it would take 3 or 4 turns just to walk to it. And some
enemies won't help you out by destroying the land and giving
you an angle you can use (for example if a Turtle hits you
directly, it won't even touch the land below your feet). In those
situations, it is smarter to just create your own angle so you can
start using shot 2. If you try to pound the enemy with shot 1 all day,
and they're doing almost twice as much damage with their shot 2,
then you are sure to lose. But if you create an angle that allows you
to hit with shot 2, then you have a chance. Just fire shot 1
directly behind you (not in front of you, or else you have to
walk all the way to the front of the crater you just made).
<p>
If you're stuck deep in a pit, and the enemy has just ruined
your angle, then the smartest thing you can do is get close
to the wall in front of you, then turn and fire shot 1 a bit behind you.
You waste a turn now, but you'll have the needed angle for
your next turn. Also, by staying close to the wall you can hide
a bit from your enemy's next shot. The stupidest thing you can do
is to cling to the wall and try to blast through all the land in front of you.
Turtle is not good at blasting through dirt and it would waste a lot of
turns trying to shoot through so much of it.
<p>
<h2>Ruining their angle:</h2>

<p>
The situation shown above is something you can do to the enemy, 
if you have sharp aim and use shot 1 . Look for opportunities
where an enemy is deep in a pit or very close to a steep section of land.
Try to plant your shot 1 directly in front of their feet, without hitting them
directly. Your goal is to make a nice round hole in the land, not to hurt
them. By doing this you can 'steal' a turn from them by forcing them to
waste a turn creating a new angle or blasting through land. Sometimes,
if the wind is helpful, you can do this over and over, splashing them
for a little damage each time while constantly ruining their angle. Remember
how I mentioned earlier that it's possible to get 3 turns in a row against an
enemy if they fire a dual as their first shot? This is a good time to practice
your angle raping skills, especially if the enemy is already bellied up
close to a steep slope. You can fire a pair shot 1's in front of their feet to
create the kind of hole that ruins their angle, then try to hit a dual
shot 2 directly onto their back. If everything goes correctly they will
have taken over 600 damage and have no angle.
