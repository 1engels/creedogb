<body>Some random fun stuff in gunbound to look cute (or pro).<br>
Most of it is very old news but some I found only recently.<br>
<br>
Armor -<br>
<br>
Mini-SS: use about 1.7 bars of power for a very late SS that<br>
opens right in the opponent's face.<br>
Angle 80 travels just under 1/4 screen.<br>
I guess max distance happens around angle 45 at a bit over half<br>
screen. You must be very careful of height differences where the<br>
enemy is above you. I don't have a lot of experience with this yet<br>
but I guess the rule of thumb to use is angle 78 is about 1/4 screen<br>
and angle 60 for half screen. 1 bit past half screen is max range.<br>
<br>
Long range shotgun SS: it's not really shotgun but at angle 32, using<br>
about 3.05 bars of power will allow you to send an SS at an enemy<br>
exactly 1.5 screens away from you. Because the angle is flat and the<br>
power is high, it covers the distance quickly and barely opens in<br>
their face. Watch for elevation and use 3.1 if they're above.<br>
<br>
Hurricane SS: It's not super rare to be in a situation where you and<br>
an enemy are very close and a hurricane appears on you. It can seem<br>
kind of lame because hitting them for high damage seems risky, even<br>
a 1 inch shot can be screwed up with hurricanes. A trick I learned<br>
is to get a pretty high angle (80's?) and fire your SS with barely<br>
any power. It will slowly go up through the hurricane and stay in<br>
the air so long it opens before it leaves the hurricane.<br>
When it does leave the hurri, the power is almost nothing, and as<br>
long as the wind doesn't screw up the shot, it should drop straight<br>
down next to the opposite side of the hurri. That's a pretty sure way<br>
to land a lot of shots with a lot of mobiles vs an enemy in that<br>
position. Don't try it outside the hurricane or it will bounce off<br>
at such low power :o<br>
<br>
Dual+ angle rape: it's easiest when wind is against you. Fire a <br>
dual+ in the wrong order, with shot 2 first. Try to get shot 2 to land<br>
just at their feet at a fairly high angle. If done right it misses a<br>
bit and they drop into the hole it makes. Then your shot 1 follows<br>
and makes a big underground hole. If it hits just right they will be<br>
left with no angle to shoot at you.<br>
<br>
Boomer -<br>
<br>
Mini-SS: From Rearview... use 1 bar of power. 80 lands right in<br>
front of you. Every 5 angles lower makes the shot travel 1 mobile's<br>
width further. Lowest recommended angle is about 50. Again watch <br>
elevation, use 1.1 or 1.2 bars vs higher enemies. The nice thing about<br>
this SS is that unless you're dumb and don't use enough power, there's<br>
a lot of room for error. You can miss a bit and still hit for 300+<br>
damage. Max range is maybe 1/3 screen at angle 50.<br>
<br>
High power backshot: From Honghong, use 2.5 bars of power and<br>
a low angle. You can safely go up to 2.9 bars without changing the<br>
landing position of the boomerang much and without risking the shot<br>
dropping down and hooking. Looks coolest when you use it to touch<br>
a faraway force or thunder before the shot bends backwards.<br>
<br>
Full power backshot: I still don't have this down. The idea is to use<br>
the high power formula, then measure distance differenly when deciding<br>
on the final angle. Supposedly 1 screen distance is made up of about<br>
20 angles when doing full power backshots (it's 30 parts using the<br>
2.5 bar method). My experience is it's sometimes more and sometimes<br>
less than 20 parts depending on wind direction. S4yo says to try<br>
using 2 angles less than the 2.5 backshot method. It will help to<br>
memorize that with 24 wind diagonal (45 degrees up wind) you can<br>
hit half screen with 50 full.<br>
<br>
Thunder Bunge: This is one of my favorite old tricks, I saw it early<br>
when I was playing and rarely afterwards. In fact I saw it so long<br>
ago that the enemy was bunged through Metamine, which doesn't have<br>
thunder or force anymore (although I hear they have it in korea GB).<br>
All you have to do is make it pass through lightning and move boomer<br>
or control power carefully so that it's a perfectly centered hit.<br>
Each hit of the thunder sinks the enemy lower and lower, and you<br>
should be getting 8 hits from your dual. I've seen enemies pass <br>
through adiumroot before from this. I'm sure they can be bunged<br>
through metropolis and nirvana too. At long range, like a 1 screen<br>
distance shot, you must plant the boomerangs a little in front and<br>
miss the enemy. The shot digs a deep pit and the lightning strikes<br>
erode the land under the enemy and drop him in the pit.<br>
I'd never believe an 81 full shot could bunge like this until I saw it.<br>
<br>
Facial SS: I need more testing with this. Here's the best I've come<br>
up with for half screen and 1 screen timebomb SS.<br>
Half screen: 40, 1.4 bars<br>
Full screen: 18, 2.5 bars.<br>
You can also do 20, 2.5 but it doesn't look as cute.<br>
<br>
Inside-hurricane hook bomb: Ever see someone using boomer and<br>
sitting inside a hurricane, and they fire upwards into it... wind is<br>
against them, and when their shot exits the nado it seems to have <br>
no power and just gently hooks down to hit an enemy on the other side?<br>
I don't have the formula for it but it depends on wind and stuff<br>
anyway. Different angles make the shot exit at different heights<br>
in the hurri, and you choose the height that you think will cause<br>
the shot to drift diagonally into the enemy. A simple rule to start<br>
with is to pick the angle you'd use for a normal hook at lower 2 or<br>
3 degrees when up close.<br>
<br>
Angle ruining with shot 1: This needs a very lucky situation where<br>
the enemy is up against a very high, steep wall to get angle. If you<br>
are pretty sharp with your formulas in 0 wind you can not only control<br>
where your shot will land, but also try to make it hit in front<br>
or behind a bit. Land shot 1 in front a bit and you can ruin the<br>
angle of bots like turtle who love to stick to high walls.<br>
<br>
Weird long shotguns: On many maps you can shotgun across 1.5 or even<br>
2 screen distances if you just take a minute to memorize some basic<br>
angles. For an enemy 1 screen away and level with you, angle 5 is ok.<br>
For 1 end of metamine to the other (from the far left or right inner<br>
slopes) is about angle 11. That's over 2 screens. You can go from<br>
one wing of dragon to the other with maybe angle... 16 I think.<br>
From 1 end of adiumroot to the other is something I still need to<br>
research. I want to say it's about 20?...<br>
Basically, don't be afraid to try long range shotguns because they're<br>
really easy shots and very sloppy, you can aim almost by just using<br>
your eyes (and a ruler :P) and a little wind is not a major problem.<br>
The enemy makes a big target when the shot is approaching at a flat<br>
angle, and your misses are easy to compensate for. This is also one<br>
of the easiest and most reliable ways to make sure shots through <br>
hurricanes, in those situations where you must hit a dual through<br>
a nado I use shotguns a lot. Even though most people look down on<br>
shotguns, nobody complains at 2 screen distance shotguns. Memorize<br>
shotgun angles for unusual maps that nobody else has memorized,<br>
like sea of hero or metropolis. People will think you're crazy pro.<br>
Props to Talent for his metamine shotgun guide.<br>
<br>
Sate -<br>
<br>
Cake SS tag trick: I love this trick, it's the most fun way to do<br>
bunge games in avatar off. It works like this. You either have a<br>
partner playing cake, or have cake as your tag. You are sate and fire<br>
an SS that 'accidentally' misses just a little bit behind the enemy.<br>
It helps if the map is adiumroot. There's now a hole all the way<br>
through the map and the enemy's in front of that hole. You can't push<br>
them off with cake SS anymore, but a skilled partner can fire JD's<br>
shot 2 right into the back of the hole your SS just made.. and it <br>
sucks the enemy down the tube for an easy and funny 2 turn kill.<br>
The same can be done with missed boomer duals, but I think Sate's<br>
SS makes it easier.<br>
<br>
Low angle shotgunning: When on the right and shooting left, low angle<br>
shotguns are quite strong. Sate always wants his shot to land a bit<br>
to the right of the enemy, so when shotgunning from the right your<br>
tracer will naturally stop when it hits the right edge of their body,<br>
and your shot 2 will rain down for full damage. This is important to<br>
know because it allows for easy and reliable SS shots from right<br>
to left (while shotgunning the SS left to right often results in a<br>
half miss or almost 0 damage). You can even try SS through hurricanes<br>
as long as you're on the right side, you'd be surprised at how easy it<br>
is to hit on your first try. People will think you're pretty sharp if<br>
you land a tracer on the enemy through the hurricane and all the<br>
lasers from your shot 2 miss... but your SS on the next turn hits<br>
for full damage.<br>
<br>
Raon -<br>
<br>
High angle babies: Old news to raon pros, fire shot 2 at angle 89<br>
full or angle 88 a bit less than full and your babies can both come<br>
down and hit the opponent's core for full damage. When wind is against<br>
you, I think it's possible to use even lower angles to do it.<br>
<br>
Baby poop: Sometimes the enemy is next to you in a small pit (maybe<br>
a pit you created). You can't get a low enough angle to hit with<br>
raon's infamous shotgun babies. Instead, if you climb down the front<br>
slope of their pit and then turn around, you'll be facing pretty much<br>
straight up. If you can get an angle 89 backwards you can fire babies<br>
with low to medium power and with an accurate center hit they'll both<br>
explode. If wind is blowing towards the enemy, you can use angle 90<br>
or lower to get the same effect. If the pit happens to be deep and<br>
you can put raon directly above the enemy, it's possible to just tap<br>
shot 2 with angle 90 and let the babies pass through your body and<br>
smack theirs.<br>
<br>
Raon slip: Shotgun babies at the underside of thin land and they<br>
will teleport to the other side of the land (and hit the enemy) as<br>
long as the ground you're trying to slip through is only a few<br>
pixels thick.<br>
<br>
Raon slip 2: If lightning or thor is out, you can shotgun through<br>
slightly thicker bits of land, thor will smash some of the ground<br>
for you and make it thin enough to allow the raon slip to work.<br>
<br>
Raon bounce: you can bounce raon's babies off the ceiling and cause<br>
them to fall straight down onto an enemy and explode for full damage.<br>
<br>
Nobrainer SS: Some raons use SS right away so that it returns later<br>
in the match, others wait until they need a sure shot for a kill, and<br>
others wait until they can try ruining the enemy's angle once they're<br>
in a pit. I like to use it to make difficult shots quite easy. <br>
With the SS, long range hurricane shots can be sloppy, and you don't<br>
have to work to do 250+ dmg to an enemy who is hiding behind a wall<br>
of dirt when the wind is strong. (which makes using babies harder).<br>
I especially like nado SSes because you do useful damage but can also<br>
get a preview of where your next shot will land if you switch to shot<br>
1 or 2 next. It's like a test shot that still does good damage.<br>
<br>
Angle fukkage: When the wind is against you fairly strongly, fire<br>
a dual shot 1 at the enemy with a fairly high angle. Aim to plant it<br>
just behind them. I usually use 2.5 bars of power (the fixed power<br>
formula) to try to measure the shot. The idea is to have the shot<br>
blowing towards you a bit by the time it hits the ground. So it will<br>
land behind the enemy and be moving towards you and make a nice<br>
diagonal hole (the bottom of the hole leans towards you). If the<br>
dual knocks the enemy into the hole, they will have a big cliff of <br>
land leaning directly over their head and cannot shoot out. Laugh<br>
as lightning spends the next 2 or 3 turns trying to dig through it.<br>
<br>
Turtle -<br>
<br>
Type 3 SS: I credit to Ramza for showing me this<br>
(indirectly with a screen shot). It works sort of on the same idea<br>
as the armor tornado SS trick. You fire your SS with an upward angle<br>
and barely any power. It spins through the hurricane very slowly and<br>
opens up halfway around. When it exits the other side, all the balls<br>
are clustered in a vertical line and drop directly on the enemy, if<br>
you're lucky enough to have an enemy right next to the nado on the<br>
other side.<br>
<br>
Mage -<br>
<br>
Is there anything fun to do with mage? I can't think of anything.<br>
The best you can do is look for situations where you can direct hit<br>
someone with an SS and also take out another nearby bot's shield for<br>
high total damage. You also have a nice shot 1 that makes big holes<br>
so try to plant a high angle shot 1 just in front of the enemy<br>
mobile to ruin their angle and possibly cost them a turn.<br>
<br>
Nak -<br>
<br>
High angle scariness: High angles are actually useful for nak, not<br>
just showing off. The higher your angle is when the shot enters the<br>
ground, the less distance it has to travel forward while underground.<br>
Anyway the basics of nak high angling are: Angle 85 hits the front<br>
side of a mobile who is positioned half a screen away (so 85 is good<br>
enough as a half screen distance measurement). 80 lands quite a bit<br>
in front of 1 screen, so exactly 1 screen distance should be counted<br>
as 79 with almost full power, not 80 full. A simple wind adjustment<br>
trick: If you already know the high angle measurements for 0 wind,<br>
and the wind is now blowing against you, just use this formula: <br>
lower your angle by 2/3 of the wind. ...So if wind is blowing at 21<br>
against you, just lower your angle by 2/3rds of 21, which works out<br>
to 14 angles. A half screen shot would go from angle 85 to angle 71.<br>
<br>
Angle screwing: There are so many ways to do this with nak.<br>
Easy method (close combat): If the enemy is already in the front of<br>
a small pit, hang your ass out over the edge of the pit and drop a<br>
dual shot 2 with 0 power (or very close) on the front of their mobile.<br>
They will be put into a deep hole and if their climbing ability isn't<br>
awesome they may end up with no angle. If wind is blowing against nak<br>
a little bit this works even better, as the shot travels backwards<br>
and makes the hole directly under nak's body.<br>
Easy method part 2 (close to middle range): If the enemy is on the<br>
front of a tall slope, get a low angle and shotgun shot 2 through<br>
land so that it comes out the other side of the slope. The hole<br>
that you make can completely screw their angle and force them to<br>
shoot through lots of land. Sometimes you can't easily make shot using<br>
shot 2 to accomplish this. A good nak player will recognize the<br>
chance to screw angle and use the SS to do it instead.<br>
Trick method: A low angle shot 2 is also great at ruining angles<br>
on maps with lots of little hills like metamine and miramo town. You<br>
can almost shotgun your shot 2 across the screen and clip the<br>
backsides of the small hills that your enemy is using to get angle<br>
against you.<br>
Harder method: If you get good at high angles, after one successful<br>
shot you should know fairly accurately where the next shot will land.<br>
You can try to make the next shot hit a bit in front of the enemy so<br>
that instead of hitting their middle for max damage, it hits their<br>
front to ruin their angle. The easiest way to do this is to just make<br>
the same shot you did last time but walk backwards a little bit before<br>
you shoot. Dual to screw their angle more thoroughly (but usually<br>
that means sorta low damage for your high delay dual).<br>
<br>
Grub -<br>
<br>
Angle fukkage: Old news to grub players, use lightning with shot 2<br>
and hit the enemy with a nicely lined up high angle shot 2. You must<br>
land the balls directly on them, not let the balls roll into them.<br>
If done correctly the lightning makes a tiny 1 cm deep narrow pit<br>
and the enemy will be inside it and may not even be able to get a<br>
decent angle, or if they can they're forced to shoot through dirt.<br>
<br>
High angle SS: Not everyone understands that grub's SS 'countdown'<br>
doesn't begin until it hits land, so it's fine to fire high angle<br>
lobs and full power SS shots at the enemy, as long as they're in the<br>
kind of pit where you know the SS will land for nice damage. If the<br>
enemy gets knocked into a thin hole made by missed boomer shot 2's or<br>
sate's SS you can get really good damage by trying to drop the ball<br>
directly down the chute so that it doesn't touch the walls going in.<br>
<br>
Flat land SS: SS on flat ground?! yeah, you can. On perfectly flat<br>
land if you're close to the enemy (like they're on one of the small<br>
hills on metamine and you're on the slope next to it) you can try<br>
for a very high angle and fairly low power like 1.7 bars or so. If<br>
the shot doesn't have to move forward much it will bounce off the<br>
ground and keep bouncing while moving forward very little. It's good<br>
for 400ish damage if done correctly.<br>
