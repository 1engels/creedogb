Introduction<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I've been using Lightning (aka Lovebot) ever since my newbie days (maybe those<br>
days aren't over yet), and have become fairly proficient with it. Seeing how<br>
painful it was to for me learn how to use Lightning properly, I thought I'd<br>
write a guide to make it easier for those who want to start using this mobile.<br>
I know this guide is long. But I've tried to be as comprehensive as possible,<br>
and Lightning is a complicated mobile. Take note that Lightning is most suited<br>
for novices to experts players. This guide is written with the assumption that<br>
the reader is an experienced Gunbound player.<br>
<br>
No Love for Lovebot!<br>
<br>
There are a large number of players out there who hold the opinion that<br>
Lightning is weak. Do not believe them! This belief usually stems from not<br>
understanding how this mobile really works. I can't blame them though, because<br>
Lightning's strengths aren't immediately obvious, and it requires a different<br>
way of playing. Lovebot is a strategic mobile, to be used by players who<br>
understand delay, angle blocking, trickshots, etc...<br>
<br>
<br>
Update 2.00<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
It's been a year since I posted version 1.00 of this guide. Since then many<br>
things have changed for Lightning.<br>
<br>
<br>
- general editing: Changed and corrected the text here and there.<br>
<br>
- all true angle: At the time I wrote v1.00, Lightning's shooting angle was 22,<br>
                  with 12 true angle. Now the angle is 32 all true, and it<br>
			looks like they raised it by 10 degrees or so. Therefore<br>
			Lightning no longer has a tiny firing angle. Thank you<br>
			Softnyx!<br>
<br>
- lower delay: In addition to raising and increasing Lightning's angle, its<br>
		   delay was also lowered by 20! Shot 1 now is 730 delay, and shot<br>
		   2 is 780. Not sure what the numbers for the SS is, but I'm<br>
		   guessing it's 20 less as well, since it looks like they lowered<br>
		   base delay. May seem like much, but it really does makes a big<br>
               difference.<br>
<br>
- HP: Lightning's HP seems to be closer to 750 than the 800 posted previously.<br>
 <br>
- splash damage: Lightning's splash damage was always 76 for non-metallic bots, <br>
                 but I had used 75 for the sake of simplicity. The correct<br>
                 amount of 76 is used now.<br>
<br>
- Section 2.3: Has been updated to describe how base damage and electric<br>
               damage are added.<br>
<br>
- Added 2.6. Shot 2 land destruction <br>
<br>
- Section 3.2: Having learned a few things since v1.00, I've changed this<br>
               section alot.<br>
<br>
- Section 5: The whole section on avatar equipment has been scrapped. I've<br>
             given up on avatar-on games mainly due to the attitude of many<br>
             player on those servers :(<br>
<br>
- Added Mobile specific strategy section<br>
<br>
- Added a section devoted to weather<br>
<br>
- Added Lightning formulas<br>

<br>
Shot 1 ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Angle: 32<br>
Max damage: ~200<br>
Delay: 730<br>
Weight: light<br>
Description: a single vertical lightning bolt strikes where the tracer lands.<br>
Has a wide electrical splash damage area which does 76 damage to nearby bots.<br>
On natural prey bots, shot 1 can consistently do ~220 damage. Requires high<br>
accuracy to do maximum damage. Note the high damage for low delay.<br>
<br>
Shot 2 ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Angle: 32<br>
Max damage: 250-300 (on a single target)<br>
Delay: 780<br>
Weight: light<br>
Description: this is the shot that makes Lightning complex. 2 bolts of<br>
lightning strike diagonally roughly 45 degrees from the left and the right to<br>
where the tracer lands, like a V. The left bolt strikes a fraction of a second<br>
before the right bolt. For this reason, when you hit a speck of land, the bolts<br>
will make a y instead of a V. In practice, damage is around 200-250 on<br>
reasonably accurate shots. To do more damage requires you to land the tracer<br>
ever so slightly to the right of your target with *pinpoint* accuracy and for<br>
them to be sitting on a slope. Shot 2 has a wider splash area than shot 1,<br>
which makes it good for double kills (dk).<br>
<br>
SS ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Angle: 32<br>
Max damage: ~160 (on an isolated target)<br>
Delay: 1280<br>
Weight: light<br>
Description: shoots a bird shaped projectile and creates a huge radius where it<br>
lands. For every enemy inside the radius, a single vertical lightning bolt will<br>
strike precisely where the bot stands. The bolts do splash damage, so that if<br>
two enemies are near each other, they will each be hit for more damage than if<br>
they were far apart. When 2 enemies are close they each get splash damage from<br>
the lightning bolt of their neighbour as well. The SS will do more damage to a<br>
group of enemies close together than to the same number of enemies further <br>
apart. Teammates are not targeted and are only hit by splash damage. VERY good<br>
for dk. Also, the SS projectile is slightly larger than the one for shot 1 and<br>
2.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Lovebot Quirks<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Here are some unique characteristics of Lightning and how to deal with them<br>
effectively. Most of them can be bad or good depending on usage, and the<br>
situation. <br>
<br>
2.1. Non-solid tracer ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
When you shoot, you must remember that the projectile itself will go through<br>
bots. The tracer only stops when it hits land. Likewise, the resulting<br>
lightning bolt will also go through bots and only stop when it hits land.<br>
That's why Lightning always bunges by the same amount, whether you hit a target<br>
directly or not. You have to aim so that the tracer lands at the center of<br>
where the target is standing, not the bot itself. This explains why shotgunning<br>
with Lightning is rarely effective. Trying to hit a bot standing on a pixel can<br>
be very frustrating. On the bright side, you can safely fire right through<br>
teammates!<br>
<br>
2.2. Tracer trickshots ---------------------------------<br>
Lightning is a tracer bot. Like A. Sate and Aduka, you don't necessarily have<br>
to shoot where the target is to hit. So it can be really useful when you don't<br>
have a direct shot at your enemy. But also, if there is land between your<br>
target and the trajectory of the bolt, then the bolt will be blocked by the<br>
land. Very annoying on "layered" maps like Stardust, Metamine B side, and<br>
especially Nirvana B side.<br>
<br>
Shot 1<br>
The easiest trick shot to do. Simply fire so that the tracer lands directly<br>
below your target, either at the chuck of land they are standing on, or at the<br>
ground below them. If the land they are standing on is thin, fire at the ground<br>
below. This is because a hit will bunge them, and they will fall straight down<br>
to where the tracer landed. If you fire upwards to where they were standing and<br>
they get bunged down, you will have to recalibrate your shot to hit them again.<br>
But if you shot at the ground below, you won't need to recalibrate your shot,<br>
since they get bunged down to where your tracer landed. Avoid using shot 1 when<br>
there is land right above your target.<br>
<br>
The shot 2 V<br>
Since the shot 2 bolts come down in a V pattern, you can shoot a tracer<br>
diagonal to a target and hit them. This is the most useful shot for hitting<br>
multiple targets and getting a dk. It just takes abit of thinking to estimate<br>
where the 2 bolts will strike. It's easier for you to see shot 2 for yourself,<br>
and imagine how to hit multiple targets with it, than it is for me to describe<br>
how to do it here. Not to be used when there is land blocking on both sides of<br>
your target, such as when they are in a hole. It's also very easy to hit<br>
yourself or teammates with this shot, splash damage isn't too bad, but a<br>
direct hit of a bolt can do 200+. All it takes is abit of thinking before<br>
shooting to use shot 2 effectively.<br>
<br>
The shot 2 y:<br>
Because the shot 2 left bolt strikes before the right bolt, if you fire on a<br>
speck of land, the left bolt will destroy the land, and the right bolt will go<br>
right through where the land used to be. This creates bolts in the shape of a<br>
y, meaning that you can hit targets diagonally below and to the LEFT of where<br>
your shot landed. This also explains why you do better damage by landing the<br>
tracer slightly to the right of your target. Whenever you see this, it will be<br>
in the shape of a y, never a reverse y. This trick also works well on ledges.<br>
The situations where you'll have the opportunity and the need to use this y<br>
effect are rare. But it's important to keep it in mind to avoid hitting<br>
yourself or teammates.<br>
<br>
2.3. Base and electrical damage ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Similar to JD and Aduka, Lightning shots deal electrical splash damage in<br>
addition to their base damage. The way each bolt deals damage is roughly: <br>
shot 1 = 125 base + 76 splash = ~200 total damage (against metallic bots splash<br>
does 82). The splash part of the damage is not cumulative and only happens once<br>
per shot. This means that a dual would not deal splash damage twice, it would<br>
deal base damage twice and splash damage once: 125 base + 125 base + 76 splash<br>
= ~325 total damage. Splash damage has a fairly wide area, and is useful for<br>
damaging more than one enemy. On the other hand, in close combat situations you<br>
might end up damaging yourself or your teammates. Note that the electrical<br>
damage comes from the lightning bolt itself, and that the base damage comes<br>
from the physical explosion of land caused by the bolt.<br>
<br>
2.4. Light projectile ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Lightning is the only mobile that fires a light projectile. It actually has the<br>
same weight as a teleport shot. This means that your shots are very sensitive<br>
to wind compared to most other bots (except Boomer). On far shots, a difference<br>
of *1 wind* will make you miss if you don't adjust your power and/or angle.<br>
Wind going with (tailwind) or against (headwind) your shot can be good or bad<br>
depending on the angle you can get. But mostly, it's better to have headwind,<br>
so that your tracer comes straight down on your enemy. Even moderate tailwind<br>
can make hitting opponents in holes impossible.<br>
<br>
2.5. Constant bunging ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
As described above, both the tracer and lightning bolt are non-solid, going<br>
right through bots and hitting land. Your shots will always bunge by the same<br>
amount, even on a direct hit on your enemy. The good side of this is that you<br>
will constantly be changing your opponent's firing position and angle. The bad<br>
side of this is that you will often have to readjust your shot if you want to<br>
keep hitting your opponent. Especially at low angles, you'll have to decrease<br>
your power, or adjust your angle. The most frustrating consequence of the<br>
constant bunge is its effect on dual/dual+. You'll find that at low angles,<br>
the first shot will hit and bunge, making the second shot miss. For this<br>
reason, it's preferable to shoot so that your tracer comes down vertically on<br>
your opponent. One way to do this is to use high angles. The second way is to<br>
shoot into headwind. In those cases you won't need to re-adjust your shot every<br>
time. A problem with shot 1 is that if your opponent doesn't move, they will<br>
end up in a deep narrow hole. Again, to keep hitting your opponent in a hole,<br>
you have to use a high angle, or shoot in headwind.<br>
<br>
2.6. Shot 2 land destruction and damage ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Because the shot 2 left bolt strikes before the right one, if you look closely<br>
you'll notice that the hole it makes is *always* the same. It's always slanted<br>
downward to the left, with a tiny overhang on the left side. This means that<br>
if the opponent is sitting in the hole, their shot to the left is blocked, but<br>
*not* their shot to the right. Unless you had shot with Thor or thunder weather<br>
effects, they'll be able to climb out however. The orientation of the hole is<br>
important to know because it'll determine what your enemy will do. If your<br>
opponent wants to shoot left, he has to climb out of the hole, whereas he<br>
doesn't need to climb out to shoot right. This makes a difference on how you<br>
want to block someone's angle (see Section 3.2.4.).<br>
<br>
Another unusual characteristic of shot 2 is that its damage varies depending<br>
on terrain, supposing both bolts hit. It tends to do more damage on targets<br>
sitting on a incline going upwards to the right. It could either be a slight<br>
slope, or the right side of an indentation they're leaning on. On metallic bots<br>
it can do up to 300 damage. For creature bots it can reach around 270 or so,<br>
which is pretty awesome for 780 delay!<br>
<br>
2.7 The Avatar-on Juggernaut ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Shot for shot, Lightning is unquestionably the strongest bot in avatar-on.<br>
The combination of high defense, low delay, and defense ignoring splash damage<br>
might make it seem really unfair to other mobiles. However crafty non-Lightning<br>
players have a few options to beat a Lightning in avatar-on. First is to use<br>
tunneling tactics with Bigfoot or Boomer. Second is to use a Nak to shoot from<br>
underground when he eventually holes you. Using Mage might seem like a good<br>
idea, but in reality isn't that strong against Lightning in avatar-on.<br>
Lightning's delay and angle raping eventually catches up with Mage.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. How to win with Lovebot<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Alright, now that you have a good background on how Lightning works. You must<br>
now learn to win!!! In this section I'll outline Lightning's general strategy,<br>
and tactics for specific situations. Basic Gunbound strategy also applies to<br>
Lightning, but this being a Lovebot guide, I won't cover them.<br>
<br>
3.1. General Lightning strategy ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
The key to Lightning is low delay, so be sure you understand how to control<br>
delay. Combined with accuracy, Lightning has the best damage to delay ratio of<br>
any mobile. Shot 1 does 200 for 730 delay. Shot 2 does 225-250 for only 780<br>
delay! In theory, you could effectively play a game with only shot 1. The only<br>
way for other bots to keep up with your low delay is to use shot 1. In that<br>
case you will do more damage than they will. Low delay combines well with your<br>
shield regeneration (+20/turn). In general, make sure you have at least 1 turn<br>
for every turn your opponent has. Occasionally you'll be able to lap a turn as<br>
well. Also, if you're ahead on delay (meaning you have less), you can use items<br>
without your opponent lapping a turn. Lightning's natural high defense and high<br>
total HP also helps you last long enough for your accumulated lead in delay to<br>
become effective.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind the low dual damage when trying to finish someone off with dual or<br>
dual+. This forces you to use a dual/dual+ abit later than other bots to finish<br>
off. If you are ahead enough in delay, you can use dual+ safely even if it<br>
won't finish them off. Don't use a dual if it won't finish them off! The damage<br>
is simply not worth the delay. Try to use an item only if you are ahead enough<br>
in delay to cover it. Meaning that even if your enemy fires a shot 1, they<br>
won't be able to go twice in a row. Although you'll find that you can sometimes<br>
win games without using any items at all.<br>
<br>
3.2. Tactics ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
3.2.1. Turn Lapping<br>
<br>
With the proper delay control, it is a certainty that you will lap turns on<br>
your opponent at least once unless they only shot 1. There are only 3 bots you<br>
may not lap turns on, JD, Bigfoot, or another Lightning. This extra turn makes<br>
up for the your low dual damage. Two shots in a row is very important to<br>
Ligthning's overall strategy. It lets you put opponents in a hole without using<br>
duals while allowing you to do maximum damage. Your shields also benefit from<br>
an extra turn of regeneration. Sure it's not alot, but in a close game every<br>
point of life counts.<br>
<br>
<br>
3.2.2. Putting the enemy in a hole<br>
<br>
This can be accomplished with a simple shot 2. Although it won't be deep enough<br>
to prevent them from climbing out. The most effective method is to use dual+<br>
shot 2. The shot 2 puts them in the initial hole, and then shot 1 makes it<br>
deeper, all the while keeping the hole narrow. Multiple shot 1 can also be<br>
used, if your opponent doesn't move. Dual shot 1 can also be used, but not<br>
recommended due to the low damage/high delay. It's important to keep in mind<br>
that putting your enemy in a hole can be very bad for you, since it will become<br>
harder to hit them. In general, only put your enemy in a deep hole if you have<br>
a high enough angle to keep hitting, or you have headwind.<br>
<br>
3.2.3. Shooting with heavy tailwind/low angles<br>
<br>
Heavy tailwind or a low firing angle can create alot of problems for Lovebot.<br>
Hitting someone on the opposite side of a slope or even in a shallow hole can<br>
prove to be impossible. In those cases you have 3 options:<br>
	1) go for a trickshot;<br>
	2) destroy the land directly in front of them;<br>
	3) shoot at someone else.<br>
A trickshot is only limited by the situation or your imagination. For example,<br>
opponents in shallow holes can sometimes be hit with a shot 2 y if you land the<br>
tracer on the right edge of the hole. Destroying the land directly in front of<br>
them will clear a path for your next shot, however this only works if they<br>
don't have shelter to move back to on their turn. If all else fails, remember<br>
that Gunbound is a team game, so if you really can't hit someone don't waste<br>
turns trying and shoot someone more accessible. You can always swap targets<br>
with your teammate.<br>
<br>
3.2.4. Planning ahead<br>
<br>
While it's important with any mobile to plan ahead before shooting, there's an<br>
extra factor to think about when using Lightning. That factor is the constant<br>
bunging. Each time you shoot, you have to think about your next shot. Will your<br>
current shot bunge and make your next shot harder, or even impossible? This is<br>
especially important when shooting with heavy tailwind or at low angles.<br>
<br>
Learn to maniputlate your opponent's terrain to your needs. For example,<br>
suppose your target is sitting on the opposite side of a slope in heavy<br>
tailwind and you can't get a high angle.<br>
<br>
  --> wind --><br>
<br>
<br>
                          bad guy<br>
   you                ____ <br>
                     /    \ *<br>
    #               /      \*<br>
    #              /        \--------------<br>
------------------/          <br>
<br>
<br>
In this situation, hitting directly using your low angle is impossible. A<br>
trickshot with shot 2 also won't hit well. So you start with a shot 2 on your<br>
side of the hill at the bottom, splashing him for 76. More importantly, you've<br>
made a small hole at the bottom of the slope as well as put a small dent to the<br>
right of the peak.<br>
<br>
<br>
                      __ <br>
                     /  \__ *<br>
    #               /      \*<br>
    #               \       \--------------<br>
------------------\__\       <br>
<br>
<br>
Now your opponent can choose to move or not. If he chooses to stay so he can<br>
keep his original angle and firing position, then he is open for a shot 2<br>
trickshot. All you have to do is fire a shot 2 into the small hole you made at<br>
the bottom of the slope and the right bolt will hit fully. This will deepen<br>
your "shooting hole" even more, making your next shots even easier to control.<br>
The same thing applies if he chooses to move up towards the peak of the slope.<br>
If instead he moves down the slope to flat ground, then that just solves your<br>
original problem.<br>
<br>
That was just *one* possible scenario. So plan ahead, terraform your opponent's<br>
land, and be creative.<br>
<br>
3.2.5. Angle blocking/messing ('angle raping')<br>
<br>
Properly used, Lightning is a master at angle raping. At the very least, a hit<br>
messes whatever angle they had since you're constantly destroying land. This<br>
puts pressure on them since they have to move and recalibrate their shot. It<br>
also makes them waste time and causes extra delay. Ideally what you want is to<br>
block their shot completely, forcing them to waste turns digging themselves<br>
out. In normal circumstances shot 1 is the best way to block shots. Here's the<br>
general procedure (warning: I suck at ASCII art):<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    you                      bad guy<br>
<br>
<br>
     #                          *<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Suppose your opponent is on relatively flat ground and terrain allows you to<br>
get a decently high angle. You start with shot 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
    you                      bad guy<br>
<br>
<br>
     #<br>
------------------------------  *  --------<br>
                              \---/<br>
<br>
<br>
Your opponent now has 2 options, stay in the indentation (usually for angle),<br>
or climb out. Suppose he stays, or even better you lapped turns on him. Now you<br>
have different choices depending on what direction your opponent wants to shoot<br>
(remember Gunbound is a team game, just because someone is shooting at you,<br>
doesn't mean you have to shoot back at them to win the game). If you want to<br>
block his shot to the left, the best method is a single shot 2. Because he is<br>
already in an indentation, a shot 2 will make a hole deep enough so that he<br>
can't climb out. And because shot 2 makes downward slanted holes to the left,<br>
his shots to the left will be blocked. Although depending on wind, mobile, and<br>
distance, they might be able to do a backshot by leaning on the right wall.<br>
<br>
<br>
    you                      bad guy<br>
<br>
<br>
     #                           <br>
------------------------------     --------<br>
                             |    |<br>

                             \---/  <br>
<br>
<br>
But suppose you wanted to block their right side now. This requires an extra <br>
turn. Most opponents will lean be leaning on the right side of the hole in<br>
order to shoot. So what you need is to land a shot 1 on the bottom right of the<br>
hole.<br>
<br>
<br>
    you                      bad guy<br>
<br>
<br>

                             |    |<br>
                             /   * \  <---- right side blocked<br>
                             \-----/<br>
        <br>
                          <br>
Now their right side is blocked, they may be able to shoot left though. But<br>
nevertheless, you still forced him too use a different angle for each of his<br>
shots, greatly increasing the chances of him missing.<br>
<br>
This tactic works best if you control your delay so that you lap turns. Or else<br>
they will be able to keep moving and avoid getting holed. If you don't use any<br>
items and stick to shot 1, you will be able to lap turns as soon as they use<br>
shot 2. The only exceptions are JD, Lightning, and Bigfoot, who can be viably<br>
be played using only shot 1. In these cases you may have to use a dual+, the<br>
tradeoff is doing less damage per hit. Also, you need favorable wind and a<br>
decently high angle to execute this tactic since it requires landing a shot 1<br>
into the hole. But if you really can't get that shot 1 in, an SS does the trick<br>
too, at the cost of more delay (SS usage is described in more detail later on).<br>
<br>
There's other ways to block angles as well, but the general procedure is to<br>
immobilize them in a hole, then use a properly placed shot 1. How you want to<br>
block shots is very dependent on the mobile your opponent is using. Mobiles<br>
with a low firing point like Armor, Sate, and Aduka are by far the easiest<br>
ones to block. A single properly aimed dual+ usually rapes their angle. The<br>
only bot immune to this tactic is Boomer. In that case just forget about angle<br>
blocking and concentrate on doing maximum damage. For bots with a high firing<br>
point like Turtle and Mage it takes a slightly deeper hole to block their <br>
shots since they can backshot.<br>
<br>
3.2.6. Melee<br>
<br>
For melee situations, shot 1 must be used because it has a smaller splash area.<br>
Smart opponents will try to exploit your splash damage and stay close to you,<br>
so that you will splash yourself when you shoot them. There are 3 possible<br>
solutions to this: teleport, walk away, or put them in a hole. Teleporting is<br>
sometimes the best option, it allows you to put yourself in a better firing<br>
position, ie: higher angle or shooting against the wind. Since Lightning has<br>
good movement, walking away is also a good option, terrain permitting. The only<br>
mobile that can outrun you is JD, but JD also needs a minimum distance to<br>
shoot. Usually the preferred option is to put them in a hole so they can't walk<br>
towards you. It also has the added advantage of making shots harder for your<br>
enemy.<br>
<br>
3.2.7. Using dual and dual+<br>
<br>
The different ways to use dual/dual+ with Lighting vary a lot depending on the<br>
terrain, wind, and firing angle. You have to imagine where the second shot<br>
would land after the first shot has slightly bunged your opponent. Ideally,<br>
you'd want the tracer to come straight down on your target, so that both shots<br>
land in the exact same spot. For most situations, I recommend dual+ over dual,<br>
since the damage dealt it essentially the same, for much lower delay.<br>
<br>
Dual shot 1 - 1330 delay - 325 damage<br>
This is the easiest shot to land and the one that does the most reliable<br>
damage. A good shot does around 325, which is 125 base + 125 base + 75 splash.<br>
It's also nice for putting enemies in a narrow hole that can block their shot,<br>
depending on the mobile. However, it has very high delay for only 325 damage.<br>
The first situations that I recommend using it would be either to finish<br>
someone off. The second is to put them in an angle-blocking hole, which will<br>
require them to waste a shot opening up the hole. In the second case, make sure<br>
that the hole you dig will block their shot, or else it's not worth using dual<br>
shot 1.<br>
<br>
Dual shot 2 - 1380 delay - 200-450 damage<br>
From experience, I've found that this shot is almost never worth it. The damage<br>
is much too variable and the delay too high. Because shot 2 bunges more than<br>
shot 1, the second shot of the dual shot 2 is less likely to land in the right<br>
spot to do full damage. Also, the first shot usually puts the enemy in a hole,<br>
blocking the incoming bolts of the second shot. It might be ok to use it if<br>
your target is standing on top of a hill or bump. Theoretically, dual shot 2<br>
could deal (125 base x 4) + 75 splash = 575, but I haven't been able to<br>
consistently get anything higher than 250-325. That's less damage than dual<br>
shot 1! One time I saw someone deal a lucky 450. One time. For bunging<br>
situations, dual shot 2 is better than dual shot 1 if you can get all 4 bolts<br>
to hit. But for damage purposes, just avoid it.<br>
<br>
Dual+ shot 1 - 980 delay - 325-400 damage<br>
A good low delay way to deal damage. However it can only be used if they are<br>
on flat land or high ground. Since the initial shot 1 bunges, possibly blocking<br>
the following shot 2. Shot 1 bunges less than shot 2, so you can use dual+ shot<br>
1 with a lower angle than dual+ shot 2 for the same amount of damage. A good<br>
hit does consistently around 300-350 damage. This shot works best when shooting<br>
from left to right. Since the initial shot 1 will bunge slightly, making the<br>
following shot 2 land slightly to the right of your target.<br>
<br>
Dual+ shot 2 - 1030 delay - 325-400 damage<br>
Another good way to deal damage for low delay. As opposed to dual+ shot 1, this<br>
can be used to hit mobiles already in a shallow hole. On the other hand,<br>
because the initial shot 2 bunges a lot, it requires a higher angle compared to<br>
dual+ shot 1 for good damage. This is the best method for putting them in a<br>
narrow hole they can't walk out of, and usually does around 300-350 on a good<br>
hit. This shot works best shooting from right to left (opposite of dual+ shot<br>
1). Since you have to aim the initial shot 2 abit to the right of your target,<br>
the bunge will cause the following shot 1 to land dead on.<br>
<br>

Here are a few trickshots to make players unfamiliar with Lightning scratch<br>

necessary, but great for showing off :)<br>

3.2.8. Defensive playing<br>
<br>
If you want to win against good players, you must learn the basic Gunbound<br>
tactics for minimising the damage you take. These include blocking their shots<br>
and seeking cover. I've already covered shot blocking with Lightning above.<br>
One of Lightning's strengths is its good movement, so use it to your advantage<br>
to seek cover or to put yourself in more favorable positions. What you do with<br>
your movement really depends on what mobile you're are facing. For example,<br>
against JD you should usually get closer, and against Nak you should try to<br>
walk away. The type of cover you seek is also a function of the bot shooting at<br>
you. These defensive tactics aren't unique to Lightning, but unlike other bots<br>
your good movement rate really helps position yourself more favorably.<br>
<br>
In solo and tag games, Lightning has an advantage in that it can fire right<br>
through dead mobiles' bodies. As a result, you can take cover behind bodies<br>
very easily, and bodies will offer no protection to your opponents. This tactic<br>
can be so effective that it is sometimes worth teleporting next to a body for<br>
cover.<br>
<br>
Defensive play could be a whole FAQ in itself and isn't unique to Lightning, so<br>
I won't go too deeply into it.<br>
<br>
3.2.9. Using SS<br>
<br>
Lightning's SS is very different from other mobile's. The first thing to<br>
remember about the SS is that it is NOT used to deal high damage. On a single<br>
target, it deals less damage than shot 1. The true power of the SS lies in its<br>
huge hit radius. It has the largest radius in the game. The most obvious use<br>
for it is getting a dk or hitting a group of enemies. If you can hit at least<br>
3 enemies at once with SS, then you should probably do it. The combined damage<br>
usually reaches 500. There are also more subtle tactical uses for the SS.<br>
<br>
The first tactical use for SS is blocking the shot of an enemy sitting in a<br>
hole. When an enemy is in a deep hole, it gets progressively harder to hit them<br>
with normal shots. This is because most opponents will lean on the side of the<br>
hole closest to you in order to get an angle to hit you. Hitting an enemy in<br>
such a position can become impossible depending on your angle and wind<br>
conditions. An option is to fire an SS nearby. This will cause a lightning bolt<br>
to come straight down on their position and destroy the portion of the wall<br>
that they were leaning on, causing that side of the hole to curve inwards.<br>
Most mobile's shot will be blocked this way. Be careful though, some bots may<br>
still be able to do a backshot. The high delay from the SS may allow your<br>
opponent to lap a turn, but is worth it if they need to waste a turn unblocking<br>
their shot.<br>
<br>
The second tactical use is as a test shot that will guarantee a hit. If I have<br>
enough lead in delay (about 600 lead), I move to a new position, then fire SS<br>
as my test shot. I use SS in this way if conditions make judging shots<br>
difficult. In more favorable shooting conditions, a regular test shot with shot<br>
1 or shot 2 is better since it still does splash damage on a miss, while at the<br>
same time conserving my lead in delay. There are tons of ways to use the SS,<br>
just be creative! Just 3 things to remember about it, first it requires open<br>
space above your enemy for a hit, second it doesn't target teammates, and third<br>
its projectile is slightly larger than your normal shots.<br>
<br>
3.2.10. Hitting multiple enemies<br>
<br>
It is obvious to any good player that if you can hit more than one enemy at a<br>
time, then you should do so. Therefore in situations where a shot 1 will do,<br>
but a shot 2 would hit more than one enemy, then use shot 2. Just remember to<br>
concentrate your damage on at least one mobile. Splashing many opponents for<br>
only 75 is generally less effective than doing a full 200 on a single target.<br>
It'll require some imagination on your part to exploit situations where you can<br>
hit multiple enemies.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Formulas<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Now that Lightning's angle is larger, fixed power formulas have become more<br>
useful. Remember that Lightning's strategy is based on delay, so don't take too<br>
much time aiming. <br>
<br>
This information belongs to creedo. Note that he says that he hasn't personally<br>
tested these out, so the numbers may be 0.5 off. If anybody has in fact tested<br>
these out, please email me so that I can post the corrections, if any. For<br>
instructions on how to use a windchart and formulas refer to his website at<br>
http://creedo.gbgl-hq.com.<br>
<br>
With Lightning's need for great accuracy, the 30 parts formula is best. At<br>
close range you may not be able to get the 80+ angle necessary, so you may have<br>
to use another aiming method for opponents within 1/3 screen distance.<br>

<br>
<br>
4. Weather<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Because Lightning's shots are unique, the way weather affects it is also<br>
unique. Unfortunately, weather effects don't help Lightning as much as other<br>
bots.<br>
<br>
Thor<br>
<br>
As with any other mobile, Thor helps alot with dual/dual+. Just remember that<br>
your opponent will be bunged more than usual, so you need a higher angle to<br>
make both shots land properly. Be really careful about using dual+ shot 1, the<br>
extra bunge may block your 2nd hit with shot 2. A good dual/dual+ does around<br>
400. Interestingly enough, Thor can actually hurt you more than help. A badly<br>
positioned Thor can prevent you from angle raping someone at a crucial moment,<br>
allowing them to dual you with Thor. A low angle in front of your opponent is<br>
usually bad for you:<br>
<br>
<br>
                               O   <--- good Thor!<br>
 <br>
                   <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
     #                          *<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
    you                      evildoer<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
						o   <--- so so Thor<br>
<br>
<br>
     #                          *<br>
------------------------------------------------------<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  o   <--- bad Thor!                         In this case, Thor eats away at<br>
					     the land right in front of your<br>
					     opponent, opening up a clear shot<br>
     #                          *            for him.<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
    you                      evildoer<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Force<br>
<br>
Do NOT stand behind a force beam! Since your damage comes from the lightning<br>
bolts, Force does NOT help you. To Lightning, Force is a real pain in the ass.<br>
It's important to look at upcoming weather to see if Force is coming and plan<br>
accordingly. Try to rape your opponent's angle so that he has no shot while<br>
Force is up.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thunder<br>
<br>
This one only increases your damage slightly, because the thunder electrical<br>
splash isn't cumulative with your own splash. So only the physical damage<br>
portion of thunder is added. Your bunge will be increased considerably however.<br>
Shot 1 works better with thunder than shot 2. Since shot 2 does better damage<br>
when aimed abit to the right, the thunder bolt will miss slightly. Shot 2 looks<br>
cooler though! You can see 3 lightning bolts coming down :)<br>
<br>
<br>
Tornado<br>
<br>
A nado only affects how your tracer lands, not how your lightning bolt strikes<br>
(unlike Sate). Hitting someone really close to a nado is very difficult. The<br>
nado will tend to carry the tracer right through and past them, since your<br>
tracer doesn't make contact with mobiles.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Mobile specific strategy<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
In a real 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 game, you'll never really face one single bot at a<br>
time. Often more than one person will be shooting at you and you'll have<br>
teammates to help you, since team play is an important part of Gunbound. But<br>
here are some general guidelines for 1v1 situations against specific mobiles:<br>
<br>
Aduka<br>
This mobile suffers too many weaknesses against Lightning. Being metallic and<br>
using a laser weapon (Thor), Aduka is a geared against hit damage creature<br>
mobiles such as Boomer, Ice, and to a lesser extent Turtle. The very qualities<br>
that make it a decent bot against creatures make it a horrible bot against<br>
Lightning. Not to mention that it has a low firing point, making it more <br>
vulnerable to shot blocking. A single well shot dual+ can accomplish this.<br>
<br>
Armor<br>
This mobile has 2 weaknesses that Lightning can capitalize on. First is the<br>
*huge* delay it has, and second its low firing point. Like Aduka, Armor is<br>
very vulnerable to getting its angle raped by a single dual+. Your delay<br>
advantage over Armor is simply amazing. It's really an uphill battle for Armor<br>
to fight a correctly used Lightning. I honestly think Softnyx intended<br>
Lightning to be THE Armor killer. After thoroughly owning an Armor user, expect<br>
him to pick Mage for the next game. This happens all the time.<br>
<br>
Bigfoot<br>
There are a few notable characteristics of Bigfoot to keep in mind. First off<br>
unlike most other mobiles, Bigfoot's main weapon is shot 1 (760 delay) so your<br>
delay advantage will be much less effective. Its main weaknesses are its small<br>
and low firing angle and its inability to deal alot of damage at long range.<br>
So blocking some of his missiles should be fairly easy using the standard shot<br>
blocking tactics. Putting some distance between him and you is also a good<br>
idea. And of course, watch out not to get bunged! On a side note, some good<br>
Bigfoot players may try to use tunneling tactics against you. What they do is<br>
start digging tunnels underground and shoot at you from below. Once he gets<br>
underground it gets impossible to hit because there is land above him. This is<br>
usually only a problem if you're playing 1v1 or if you're using an all<br>
Lightning team, both of which are generally a bad idea. It's important to have<br>
teammates who can hit enemies that you can't hit.<br>
<br>
Boomer<br>
This is probably the toughest mobile to beat with Lightning in a 1v1. The main<br>
problem is that Boomer isn't vulnerable to normal shot blocking tactics. So the<br>
best thing to do is concentrate on doing maximum damage and to seek abit of<br>
cover if you can. Being familiar with how Boomer shoots also helps induce him<br>
to miss. Players are usually more used to adjusting their shots horizontally<br>
than vertically, so changing Boomer's elevation with a dual/dual+ works<br>
sometimes if he's using hooks or backshots. If it's 0-1 wind then it's going to<br>
be a really tough battle. On top of that, Boomer can also use some of the same<br>
tunneling tactics as Bigfoot to some degree. In a team game, you should<br>
probably ask another teammate to "take care" of Boomer for you while you shoot<br>
someone else.<br>
<br>
JD/Cakebot<br>
In many way, this mobile is Lightning's brother. Both are shield bots, both use<br>
electrical weapons, both have good movement, and most importantly both have<br>
good delay. While most players think of JD as a bunging bot with its shot 2<br>
"suction", it can also be used to put people in holes and block shots. The best<br>
strategy is usually to use dual/dual+ to immobilize him, then block his shot.<br>
Don't expect to lap turns on him too much. In general be prepared for tactics<br>
similar to your own.<br>
<br>
Grub<br>
Well...the odds of meeting a good Grub player are very low. The odds of<br>
battling a team that can properly setup an SS situation for their Grub player<br>
is even lower. Use standard angle raping tactics and avoid being in positions<br>
that give him an easy shot 2 or SS.<br>
<br>
Mage<br>
This is an anti shield bot mobile, and Lightning is a shield bot. A perfectly<br>
shot SS does 500 damage, not to mention that Mage's shot are very predictable<br>
and easy to aim. Mage also has a relatively high firing point and a generous<br>
angle, so it takes abit more work to block his shot. Mage's effectiveness<br>
against you hinges mainly on the SS. At the beginning of the game try to stay<br>
close to an enemy shield bot if you can so that they too would get hit by the<br>
SS radius. At least until your shields are depleted from getting hit normally.<br>
The optimal "script" for a Mage playing against a Lightning is, SS, shot 1,<br>
dual shot 2 (barring weather). It's crucial that you block his angle before he<br>
can get his dual shot 2 in. The good news is that a good Mage player is very<br>
predictable. If you go before him you can start off with a dual+ and predict<br>
that he will not lap a turn on you because he will shoot an SS on his turn.<br>
<br>
Nak Machine<br>
A battle against Nak can either be really easy or really hard all depending on<br>
terrain. Your strategy against Nak depends on whether he'd be able to shoot you<br>
from underground if you were to hole him. If he wouldn't be able to hit you<br>
from underground, then you can proceed with the standard angle raping tactics.<br>
Nak has a low firing point, so a good dual+ can block his shot. However, if<br>
underground shots are possible, standard angle raping tactics won't work so<br>
avoid putting him in a hole (ie: avoid using dual/dual+). Instead concentrate<br>
on doing maximum damage. Nak's weakness is its high delay, so take advantage of<br>
that. Lightning can also move alot more than Nak, so if you keep walking away<br>
from him you can put some distance between the 2 of you and he won't be able to<br>
catch up. It's important that you avoid a melee situation.<br>
<br>
A. Sate<br>
The main weaknesses of this one is its short effective range, and its low<br>
firing point. Like Armor it can dish out alot of damage if it has a clear shot,<br>
but without the huge delay. Your priority will be to block his shots. Also,<br>
Sate has the hardest time digging itself out of deep holes, so try to make<br>
your holes abit deeper than usual if you can. Sate also has a hard time getting<br>
a clean hit if you can get any amount of land between you and his satellites,<br>
so look for ledges to hide behind or cover on top. As with Aduka and Armor,<br>
Sate can get angle raped by a single dual+.<br>

5. Game Settings/Items<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As with other mobiles, certain maps, game settings, and items, can affect the<br>
effectiveness of Lightning.<br>
<br>
5.1. Maps ---------------------------------<br>
I haven't mentioned other maps here simply because there's nothing special<br>
to write about in relation to Lightning.<br>
<br>
Nirvana B-side<br>
<br>
The all-time worst map for Lightning. Against players who exploit your<br>
weakness, it is almost impossible to win. Smart opponents will simply move<br>
under the many little "islands", rendering you completely helpless. Choosing<br>
Lightning to play on this map is suicide.<br>
<br>
Stardust and Metamine B-side<br>
<br>
Stardust and Metamine B-side are difficult, but manageable. In fact, you can<br>
hold the advantage in these two maps if you manage to get below them and do<br>
tracer trickshots. You just have to know when to use shot 1 or shot 2.<br>
<br>
Cave<br>
<br>
Since everyone starts out very close to each other on this map, you have to be<br>
careful about hitting your teammates with splash damage. Then again, it's also<br>
very easy to hit multiple opponents as well. If you have smart teammates who<br>
stay outside the radius of your shots, you should have no problems. Cave B-side<br>
is your best friend. The loads of item locks really work in your favour.<br>
<br>
5.2. Game types ---------------------------------<br>
<br>
Score and Solo<br>
<br>
In general, I have found that Lightning does better on smaller games, 3v3 and<br>
less. This is for two reasons: 1) the most popular sudden death setting is<br>
double death 40, and since Lightning does less damage on dual shots, other<br>
mobiles will deal more damage than you when double death comes around; 2)<br>
smaller games are less crowded, giving you more room to maneuver around the<br>
map. In a 4v4 game with double death 40, you will have fewer turns before<br>
sudden death than other games. The more turns you get before double death, the<br>
better. Likewise, because in solo you have the chance to kill your opponents<br>
before double death comes around, it is better than playing score. If I had my<br>
way, I would choose the other types of sudden death settings. It's just that<br>
other people don't like playing anything other than double death 40. Very<br>
boring, IMO. In 3v3, double death 40 is fine. Just try to win before double<br>
death comes. I'm not saying 4v4 score double death 40 should not be played with<br>
Lightning. It's just that it will require superior skills in order to gain an<br>
advantage over your opponents during double death.<br>
<br>
Tag<br>
<br>
I haven't played tag very much, but when I do, I like to pick Grub as my tag<br>
mobile. Grub complements Lightning's hole digging abilities. Narrow holes are<br>
excellent for Grub SS. Other mobile I sometimes choose is Armor, but that's<br>
simply my preference. Any other mobile with a "normal" shot would do, in case<br>
of situations where land blocks your lightning bolts.<br>
<br>
Jewel<br>
<br>
In jewel games you will need to be very accurate to kill jewels. SS can be used<br>
kill a group of 5s. A well aimed shot 1 is effective for 10s. 25s can only be<br>
killed with a very well aimed dual or dual+. I really enjoy playing jewel with<br>
Lightning, since you have the ability to kill multiple jewels with SS or shot<br>
2.<br>
<br>
5.3. Items ---------------------------------<br>
I prefer to have games with ALL items open, because the variety makes very<br>
interesting and strategic games. However, the most common items that people<br>
leave open are dual+, teleport, and dual. In a solo game 1 of each of those<br>
items is usually a good idea. It allows you to be more versatile, although<br>
taking 2 dual+ and 1 teleport is good as well. In score games you can forget<br>
the teleport and take 2 dual+ and 1 dual. If heals are open I suggest taking<br>
1 medkit or 2 bandages. Note: with Lightning's larger and higher angle,<br>
teleport has become less important.<br>
<br>
Dual<br>
<br>
As described above, avoid using duals. However, there are times when an<br>
opponent is in a deep hole, and a dual shot 1 is needed to finish them off.<br>
Don't pack more than 1, unless it's the only item available.<br>
<br>
Dual+<br>
<br>
The best item to pick with Lightning. Always pack at least 1 dual+, since<br>
you'll need it to dig enemies into holes. Not effective on opponents in deep<br>
holes unfortunately.<br>
<br>
Blood<br>
<br>
Can be quite effective, especially since Lightning depends on low delay. It<br>
takes off 8% of your HP, and since Lightning is a shield mobile, it takes off<br>
less life than it would on non-shield mobiles. I'm not sure if it takes 8% of<br>
your total HP, or current HP. If it were only current HP, it would make sense<br>
to use blood later in the game, after you've been shot a few times. In that<br>
case, you'd sacrifice less HP to blood. Blood shot 1 does 275 damage usually.<br>
I haven't tried it much with shot 2.<br>
<br>
Power up<br>
<br>
If possible, choose dual+ over power up. The extra delay from power up isn't<br>
worth the relatively small increase in damage. Dual+ has 100 more delay, but is<br>
also used to trap enemies in holes. Does the same damage as blood, obviously.<br>
<br>
Shovel<br>
<br>
I haven't tried shovels with Lightning yet. But it would seem to me a bad item<br>
to use. Bunging your opponents more will make it harder to hit them, and wider<br>
holes will also make it easier for them to shoot out of the hole. Although,<br>
when I have the chance, I might try putting someone in a hole without the<br>
shovel first, then shoot a shot 1 shovel, to see if it blocks their angle. It<br>
might make a bottle-shaped hole?<br>
<br>
Thunderbolt<br>
<br>
While it will increase bunge somewhat, and up damage very slightly, there is no<br>
reason to choose thunderbolt over dual+. With shot 2, you will see a third<br>
vertical lightning bolt come down. With shot 1 you won't be able to see it, but<br>
it's there. Thunderbolt is only good for mobiles that fire multiple projectiles<br>
at once.<br>
<br>
Energy 1 (bandage)<br>
<br>
For some reason, most players believe heals to be cheap noob items. I don't<br>
share that view. It simply requires a slightly different strategy to play<br>
against. With that said, I usually don't open up heals because it scares other<br>
players away. But if you get the chance, pack 2 bandages over a dual, even if<br>
heals are less effective for shield mobiles.<br>
<br>
Energy 2 (medkit)<br>
<br>
Same as bandage, although I'm not sure which would be better, 2 bandages or 1<br>
medkit. I probably won't get the chance to find out since most good players<br>
simply refuse to play in a room with heals on. Packing no more than 1 medkit<br>
seems to be effective the few times I've been able to try. I would definitely<br>
choose a medkit over a dual, but not over a dual+.<br>
<br>
Windchange<br>
<br>
A very practical item to have. Changing tailwind into headwind can save your<br>
game. Also good to screw up Boomer's shots.<br>
<br>
Teleport<br>
<br>
As I noted above, teleport is less crucial with Lightning's new and improved<br>
firing angle. But is still useful for moving to a better position if wind is<br>
unfavorable or your opponent is in your face. This item is more important in a<br>
solo/tag game.<br>
<br>
Team teleport<br>
<br>
Errrrr, well what can I say. Use this like you would with any other mobile.<br>
<br>

<br>
- this guide certainly doesn't offer exhaustive info on Lightning.<br>
<br>
- The mobile specific strategy section isn't finished yet, other bots coming<br>
  soon.<br>
<br>
- still need to cover underground tactics<br>
