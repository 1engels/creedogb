LOOK AT THIS TRICO WIND CHART! ^_^ <br>
this was found from a link that m2 posted on a trico thread earlier. i guess not much <br>
people know about it?? <br>
<p>
its found from a chinese guide by tkbb, on trico 3 in 1. <br>
i actually dont really know how to use it. basically you add to your null wind angle <br>
and power by: <br>
<p>
see if you using 50+ angle or not for your shot. red word = 50+ and blue word = 50- angle. <br>
i think you add the angle by wind * wind factor, then ... the lower row... i think its <br>
like "for every x wind you add/subtract 0.x power?" DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? <br>
<p>
like for 9 o clock against wind, the inner words say you lower (wind * 0.4) angles, and <br>
for every 6 wind, you add 0.1 power. oh =). ok it makes sense. glhf, if it works, which <br>
it should :D<br>

Another formula, found elsewhere and reposted by DvineKage:<br>
(I'll credit the author if someone can tell me whose it is)<br>
<p>
Now, my own power adjustment when wind is present. <br>
with one of the 6 powers fixed, now let's make some adjustment if wind is present. <br>
the formula is angle of the wind (approximate from the wind meter, from the wind mark <br>
to horizontal axis) The formula is: <br>
power adjustment = wind*(sin wind_angle/2 +/- cos wind_angle/4)*4/100 <br>
