<body>Boomer against the wind lobbing formula<br>
(original by HongHong, translation by Soyabean)<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This formula is a very good method for making shots against the wind with <br>
boomer.  It is an alternative to hook shots and may help in situations where a <br>
hook will fly back.  It's also good for showing off and making nice SS shots.<br>
<p>
Formula:<br>
<p>
The full formula would be 50 - (WindStrength*WindFactor), power to be judged by <br>
user using fixed power points described below.<br>
<p>
1/4 screen: 1.5 bars<br>
1/2 screen: 2.3 bars<br>
3/4 screen: 2.9 bars<br>
1.0 screen: 3.35 bars<br>
<p>
If the enemy is between these set points you must guess beforehand how much <br>
power to alter your shot, for example between 1/2 screen and 3/4 screen might <br>
use 2.6 bars or so.<br>
<p>
Once you pick your power, you now choose your angle.<br>
Start at angle 50, and in 2 wind against use the power you already calculated.<br>
If wind is stronger than 2 against, you can calculate a new angle using a <br>
method similar to calculating hooks and backshots.<br>
Multiply Wind Strength * Wind Factor.  Then subtract the result from angle 50.<br>
The new angle can be used with the same power you decided on before.<br>
<p>
The wind factors are either very similar to or the same as your hook wind <br>
factors. Therefore use this guide: <br>

<p>
Some examples: You are on left, enemy is on right.<br>
<p>
Wind is at 9 o' clock (directly against you).  Wind strengh is 15.<br>
Enemy is 1/2 screen distance.<br>
Starting at 50, you have decided to use the 1/2 screen power 2.3 bars.<br>
The wind factor for wind pointing this way is .8, so multiply .8 by wind <br>
strength (15).  The result is a nice even number, 12.  Lower by 12 angles.<br>
Now angle 50 has become angle 38.  Fire at angle 38, 2.3 bars... and you should <br>
hit an enemy half a screen away perfectly.<br>
<p>
Other examples:<br>
<p>
Wind at 6:30, strength 8<br>
Enemy is a bit over 3/4 screen distance, we decide to use 3 bars (a little over <br>
2.9)  Wind factor is .7 so we get ...5.6   ... if we lower 5 it might be a <br>
little short.  Lower 6 and we worry it will be over.  I would lower 5 and then <br>
move forward a tiny bit.  Then you can be sure it won't come short.<br>
So the angle you use is 45 (after moving forward a bit) and 3.0 bars of power.<br>
<p>
Wind at 6:00, strength 22<br>
Enemy is 1/3 screen distance.  We decide to add .2 bars of power, so 1.7 bars.<br>
Wind factor is .5, which is easy... just reduce 22 by half to get 11.<br>
Lower from 50-11 to 39, then 1.7 bars.  <br>
<p>
Wind at 11:30, strength 10<br>
This is tricky.  The wind is very floaty, and lowering your angle just makes <br>
the shot  go further.  Therefore you may want to use the usual angles, but <br>
judge how to reduce power  in order to prevent the shot from flying too far.  <br>
You may also want to go with a lower angle for more predictable shots, or just <br>
switch to full power hooks.<br>
<p>
Wind at 9:30, strength 25<br>
This is also tricky.  The calculation for wind at this angle is Strength * .3 <br>
 ...you therefore want to lower about 7 angles to angle 43.  However at angle <br>
43, any power level you choose will probably backshot.  So for this wind you <br>
want to reduce to a minimum of 37 and then judge the power level to use.<br>
<p>
Wind at 6:05, strength 21<br>
Enemy is 1/2 screen distance.  We will use 2.3 bars of power.<br>
Lower your angle by (Wind/3) and you get 7 angles.  <br>
Angle 43, 2.3 bars is the result.<br>
<p>
I hope this helps you make pro shots.<br>

ADDENDUM: Credit to MattZ0rT for sharing this neat additional info.  There is<br>
an alternate way to decide the power of the shot, using a somewhat long <br>
formula.  The good news is that by using this formula you can get a very, very<br>
accurate measurement of the correct power to use, and if you have lots of time<br>
between turns you can be sure of your shot.<br>
<p>
The power measurement formula: <br>
Distance = enemy distance in fractions of a screen, where 1 = 1 full screen.<br>
<p>
Power = -[1.4 * (Distance^2)] + [4.21(Distance)]  +  .5375<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
If you need it in simpler terms:<br>
Step 1: (multiply distance by itself, then multiply the result by -1.4)<br>
Step 2: (multiply distance by 4.21, then add the result to step 1's number)<br>
Step 3: (add .5375 to your answer from step 2) <br>
<p>
Example formula:<br>
Distance = half a screen.  <br>
If D = 1 for a full screen, then for half a screen we will use D = .5<br>
<p>
Step 1: (.5 * .5) = .25<br>
        .25 * -1.4 = -.35<br>
        result: -.35<br>
<p>
Step 2: (.5 * 4.21) = 2.105<br>
        2.105 + (-.35) = 1.755<br>
        result: 1.755<br>
<p>
Step 3: .5375 + 1.755 = 2.2925<br>
        result: 2.2925<br>
<p>
Final answer: correct power for half screen is 2.2925 bars.  It's a tiny bit <br>
more accurate than the 2.3 bars I listed earlier.  One trick you could use to <br>
tie in this formula with the 30-parts-to-1-screen measurement (which I use for<br>
lobs and backshots) is to count how many angles between you and the target, <br>
then divide the result by 30.  The small number you get can be used as "D" in<br>
the above formula to get a very accurate power level.<br>
For example, I want to know what power I need to hit 2/3rds of a screen.  <br>
We know a 2/3 screen lob uses angle 70, which is 20 distance units from boomer. <br>
Take 20 and divide by 30, you have .6666 as the result.<br>
Plug .6666 into the formula and you get this: 2.7026<br>
Does this number make sense?  Well, we know 3/4 screen is 2.9 bars.  This<br>
distance is a bit less than 3/4 screen.  So 2.7 bars should be correct.<br>
