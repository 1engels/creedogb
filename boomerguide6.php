<h1>2. Normal shot</h1>  
<hr>
<blockquote>
Pick an angle and use it a lot until you have a good feel for it. I like angle 
35 because it will never blow backwards under any wind conditions.  You may also 
want to master a slightly higher angle like angle 50, for situations where you 
need to lob over obstructing land or a teammate's head. There are also fixed
angle shooting formulas which tell you the power level to use in different
situations... I will mention them here.
<p>
<h3>Fixed angle 35 shooting:<br>
1/2 screen distance: 1.5 bars<br>
1.0 screen distance: 2.2 bars<br></h3>

<h2>Other normal shot pointers:</h2><br>
<ul>
<li>If you prefer to use feel, just be aware that low angles are easier to deal 
with when there's tailwind.  If there's a lot of tailwind, remember that a tiny
wind difference will alter your shot quite a bit.  You might find it's quite
difficult to adjust your power in these situations, I recommend moving your 
boomer a little to compensate for tiny wind changes.  This is especially true
if you're shooting far away, moving boomer is a lot easier than finding the
exact amount of power you need.
<li>Normal shots against the wind:
When shooting against the wind, decide how much harder to shoot based both on 
wind strength and direction.  The more downward the wind points, the harder you 
must shoot.  In general you must shoot much harder against the wind using boomer
than you would in 0 wind, often harder than any other mobile would need to.
If you want to master against the wind shooting you can play for a while to 
develop great feel, or you can try some formulas to start making pretty good
shots right away.

shooting method and a few easier opposite wind shooting formulas.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Other cases</h2><br>
<ul>
<li>When the wind is blowing in other directions, some very vague rules are:
Wind towards the enemy makes the shot go further, but at low angles don't need
to lower power a whole lot to accomodate this.  
Wind blowing upwards and towards messes up your normal shot the most, you need 
to drastically reduce power because the wind carries your shot forever.
Wind blowing directly down or a bit down and towards requires adding a bit of 
power, usually no more than half a bar.
Wind blowing diagonally down and towards you can almost treat as a normal shot,
or you can use slightly less power.              
</ul>
