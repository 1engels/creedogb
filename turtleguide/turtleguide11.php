<h1>2.4 formula - Part 2</h1>
<h1>Wind adjustment (shortcuts)</h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
The wind adjustment seems hard for some people because
of the decimal numbers. You're probably wondering how to
calculate decimals without a calculator (which would feel like
cheating a bit). I've made a windchart that's similar to the
general chart on my site, it gives all the little shortcuts I use
to calculate numbers more quickly.
<p>
Once you've memorized this basic info there's some advanced
wind adjustment stuff which I'll get into in the next section.
There are some tricks to make it easier when the wind's pointing
in a direction now shown on the chart.
