<body>Sadly this is the only one. There used to be a good one on gbpros.com but that site is down.<br>
<br>
Here's what I know about lightning angles. You don't need to know all of these, just pick a shooting system you like (fixed 60, fixed 30, fixed power with 30 parts, fixed power with 20 parts) and memorize those. The first 3 systems are accurate but only go 1 screen. The last one works up to 1.5 screens but you cannot get perfect accuracy as easily, because you use so much power. I recommend learning the first two. If you learn angle 60, you automatically will know angle 30 because it uses the exact same power levels. Angles like 60 and 30 are easy to get, angles like 70 and 80 are harder. <br>
<br>
Sorry if some of these are off, I haven't tested them all personally, I don't play lightning much.<br>
<br>
<br>
1/4 screen distance shots (0 wind)<br>
<br>
60, 1.1 (fixed angle 60)<br>
30, 1.1 (fixed angle 30)<br>
83, 2.2 (fixed power, 30 parts to 1 screen)<br>
85, 2.6 (fixed power, 20 parts to 1 screen)<br>
<br>
1/3 screen distance shots (0 wind)<br>
<br>
60, 1.3 (fixed angle 60)<br>
30, 1.3 (fixed angle 30)<br>
80, 2.2 (fixed power, 30 parts to 1 screen)<br>
83, 2.6 (fixed power, 20 parts to 1 screen)<br>
<br>
1/2 screen distance shots (0 wind)<br>
<br>
60, 1.6 (fixed angle 60)<br>
30, 1.6 (fixed angle 30)<br>
75, 2.25 (fixed power, 30 parts to 1 screen)<br>
80, 2.7 (fixed power, 20 parts to 1 screen)<br>
<br>
2/3 screen distance shots (0 wind)<br>
<br>
60, 1.95 (fixed angle 60)<br>
30, 1.95 (fixed angle 30)<br>
70, 2.25 (fixed power, 30 parts to 1 screen)<br>
77, 2.75 (fixed power, 20 parts to 1 screen)<br>
<br>
3/4 screen distance shots (0 wind)<br>
<br>
60, 2.1 (fixed angle 60)<br>
30, 2.1 (fixed angle 30)<br>
67, 2.3 (fixed power, 30 parts to 1 screen)<br>
75, 2.75 (fixed power, 20 parts to 1 screen)<br>
<br>
1.0 screen distance shots (0 wind)<br>
<br>
60, 2.3 (fixed angle 60)<br>
30, 2.3 (fixed angle 30)<br>
60, 2.3 (fixed power, 30 parts to 1 screen)<br>
70, 2.8 (fixed power, 20 parts to 1 screen)<br>
<br>
For wind adjustment you will have to use work to figure out fixed angles 60 and 30 (I dunno how to adjust wind for these angles using lightning). For the other 2 shooting methods, use my wind chart for fixed power, 30 parts to 1 screen. <br>

<br>
For the 20 part fixed power formula, called banpao, use these windcharts:<br>

I hope this is what you were looking for. The only other things I know about lightning are:<br>
<br>
If you can control whether your shot will hit the center, front, or back of the enemy, then try to aim to hit a little bit on the right side of the enemy (when using shot 2)... always, no matter what side you are shooting from. This will get best damage. <br>
<br>
If you are in a game with dual+, you probably will do better with dual+ than dual, and you shouldn't use dual much with lightning unless there is thor. It is not as useful with other weathers.<br>
<br>
The only time to use the SS is when you cannot hit the enemy easily any other way, or if you know it will ruin their angle (Because they are on the front of a tall hill or they are in a deep pit) or when you can hit 2 enemies at the same time for double damage. Otherwise you do very crappy damage and the SS is a waste.<br>
