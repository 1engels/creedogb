First, the charts.

To figure out your skybomb, you use the same steps
as any other formula shot:
<p>
<b>1. Figure out the shot you'd use in 0 wind (both angle and power).<br>
2. Calculate the new angle based on the windchart.<br>
</b>I always calculate angle first. Then if I don't have time to calculate 
power, I can still try the shot by feeling the power.<br>
<b>3. Calculate the new power based on the same chart.<br>
4. Walk if necessary.</b><br>
If your calculations tell you that the enemy is between 2 angles,
walk forward or backward until you think they are the correct distance.<br>
<b>5. Shoot.</b>
<p>
<p>
Example 1: Enemy is half a screen away.
Wind is 16 pointing against you.
<p>
Your 0 wind shot for half screen is 83, 3.72 bars. But, you know
that this 0 wind shot lands a little bit in front of half screen.
Before you start walking, calculate the wind. 16 * .53 is a little
bit more than 8 angles. So, if you were to lower 9 angles,
the shot would fly a little past the usual 0 wind spot.
So, you expect that by lowering 9 angles, the shot will land
at the half screen position instead of landing a little in front of it.
The enemy happens to be at the half screen position so that's
perfect for you, you don't need to move at all. For the power, just
remember you add .1 every 14 wind, this is close enough to 14
so add .1 to get 3.82 bars.<br>
Final answer: <b>74, 3.82 bars.</b>
<p>
<p>
Example 2: Enemy is 1 screen away.
Wind is 20 pointing straight up.
<p>
Your 0 wind shot is 76, 2.91. The wind angle adjustment is
difficult - Just remember than in maximum wind, you must lower 2 angles.
In 20 wind, you must lower about 1.5 angles. So if you lower 1 angle,
the shot lands half an angle too close. So walk forward a bit after 
lowering 1 angle and you'll be ok. Last do the power adjust. You should
be able to do any number divided by 3 quickly in your head.
Like 21 / 3 would be 7. This wind is close enough to 21. So you
must reduce power by .7, from 3.91 to just 3.21.<br>
Final answer: <b>75, 3.21 bars.</b>
<p>
<p>
Example 3: Enemy is a bit more than 2/3 screen away.
Wind is 18 pointing up+back.
<p>
In 0 wind, 80 goes a bit past 2/3 screen. The basic power is 3.79.
The angle change for up+back wind is .45, a bit less than half
of wind. So instead of adjusting 9 angles for 18 wind, you
should adjust only 8. The power adjust is easy, .2 every 10 wind
(or you could call it .1 every 5 wind). So in 20 wind you'd reduce
.4 bars, in 18 wind you'd reduce a bit less. Call it .35 bars. So
the new power is 3.44.<br>
Final answer: <b>72 3.44</b>
