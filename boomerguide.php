<blockquote>
Boomer is a strong mobile, Maybe the best in the game since Armor got weakened.
It has massive attack strength (probably the most reliably damaging in the game
behind knight and dragon) and he also gets the benefit of good movement, the
largest angle range, and very low delay.  The only catch is that his HP and
defense sucks, so he can die in two solid duals.  He's also hard to use, but
this guide is supposed to take care of that.
