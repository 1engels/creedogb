<body>Part 1: Terms<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
In gunbound, power is measured in 'bars'. One bar is<br>
exactly 1/4 of your power meter. Therefore your full<br>
power would be 4 bars. Half power is 2 bars, and so on.<br>
If you look at your power meter you can see little<br>
triangles marking each bar.<br>
<br>
You will see lots of measurements that have fractions of<br>
a bar. Most formulas can't easily be used with exactly<br>
2 bars or 3 bars or 4 bars. You need to use the powers<br>
in between. For example 2.5 bars is pretty common - <br>
That's 2 bars and then half of the next bar. <br>
<br>
To be more exact, sometimes you may even see something<br>
like 2.95 bars. Basically, .05 bars is the smallest amount of<br>
power you can add or subtract using slice shooting method.<br>
So if you needed 2.95 bars, you just start slicing and then<br>
release the spacebar a hair before your power level reaches<br>
the third bar. 1 'mm' is what a lot of people call .05 bars,<br>
Some people might say "1 mm less than 3 bars" instead of<br>
2.95 bars, but they're the same thing.<br>
<br>
For power levels that are a little weird, you need to use<br>
your estimation and experience. For example, 2.65 bars..<br>
it's not near the 2 or 3 bar marker. How do you know<br>
what 2.65 looks like? How can you tell if you're slicing<br>
exactly 2.65 and not 2.6 or 2.7? <br>
<br>
For situations like that, you should know simple fractions.<br>
It's not hard to estimate 1/2 of something, or 2/3 of something.<br>
To estimate 2.65... all you need to know is that 2/3 = .66.<br>
So 2.66 would be 2 bars, then 2/3 of the next bar. <br>
Since 2.65 and 2.66 are pretty much the exact same, you<br>
know that you need 2 and 2/3 bars of power.<br>
<br>
You can also measure power in pixels. Your power meter<br>
is exactly 400 pixels wide, so each bar is 100 pixels.<br>
So it's easy to know that 1.2 bars = 120 pixels. Some<br>
very precise guides show power in pixels, like "2.53".<br>
But you almost never ever have to control your power<br>
so perfectly. In fact, using slice, it's impossible to shoot<br>
exactly 2.53, you must shoot 2.5 or 2.55. You can<br>
miss by a few pixels of power and still hit the enemy.<br>
But for many formulas, you need to be able to control<br>
your power level within .05 bars (1 mm, or 5 pixels).<br>
In many cases, .05 bars over or under your intended<br>
power will cause a miss. But .02 or .03 is not a problem.<br>
<br>
Some more terms:<br>
Wind factor: This is a number, usually very small, that<br>
you can multiply the wind's strength by to get a new number.<br>
That new number will be either how many angles to adjust your<br>
shot or how much power to adjust your shot.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
Let's say the wind factor is .5 (most wind factors are fractions).<br>
If the wind factor is .5, and the current wind's strength is 6,<br>
then you multiply .5 * 6. The answer is 3. That answer<br>
tells you how many angles to adjust your shot<br>
(by either raising or lowering your angle).<br>
<br>
You will sometimes (rarely) see a power adjustment formula:<br>
Let's say the wind factor is .03 ...and current wind<br>
strength is 20. Multiply .03 by 20 and your answer is .6.<br>
This small number is how much power to add or reduce<br>
from your 0 wind shot, so if your 0 wind shot uses 2.5 bars..<br>
then in 20 wind, after you do your calculations, the new power<br>
would have .6 added to it (so new power is 3.1).<br>
<br>
Wind: When you see just the word "wind" in a formula like this:<br>
(Wind * Wind Factor) then the word 'wind' represents whatever<br>
the current wind's strength is. So if you're shooting in 10 wind,<br>
then you're multiplying 10 * Wind Factor.<br>
<br>
Distance: Distance is usually measured in 'parts'. For shots<br>
that use a fixed power and changing angle, 1 part usually<br>
is the same thing as 1 angle... Like to make your shot land<br>
1 'part' closer, you just add 1 angle.<br>
To make it land 10 parts further away, you lower 10 angles.<br>
For formulas that use a fixed angle, you will see a power level<br>
listed for each part... for example, a really precise formula<br>
will use 30 parts per screen, and will give you 30 different<br>
power levels (one to hit each part). A less accurate formula<br>
might use 4 parts, so you only have 4 power levels<br>
to remember.<br>
Getting back to the most common formula type, where<br>
1 part = 1 angle... how much distance is there in 1 part?<br>
It depends on original power and original angle. Like if you're<br>
using only 1 bar of power, then 1 part is tiny, because<br>
changing your angle by 1 won't really affect a 1 bar shot. <br>
In fact with that kind of power level you'd probably need to<br>
change your angle by 10 to make any noticeable difference<br>
in distance. But if you're using full power, then 1 angle<br>
creates a huge difference in distance.<br>
If you pick the wrong angle using a full power shot,<br>
you're guaranteed to miss. <br>
<br>
Screen: Distance can also be measured in screens.<br>
1 screen = left side of your screen to right side of your<br>
screen. It doesn't matter what size monitor you use, 1<br>
screen on gunbound is always 800 pixels wide. So your<br>
monitor and my monitor show the same amount of the<br>
map on each screen. It's not like I can buy a 40 inch<br>
monitor and see the entire map without ever moving<br>
the screen. If I have a big monitor, I still see the same<br>
amount of map as someone with a small monitor,<br>
I just see all the graphics looking larger than usual.<br>
That's why you should never trust a formula that<br>
measures distance in "inches" or "cm" or even<br>
"fingers". Only measure in screens.<br>
<br>
To be exact, 1 screen is usually measured by using<br>
right click in a game and dragging the screen around<br>
so that your body is all the way to the left or right<br>
edge of your screen. If your body is half on/half off<br>
the screen, and the enemy's body is half on/half off<br>
also, then you and the enemy are exactly 1 screen<br>
distance apart from each other.<br>
<br>
SD: Short for "screen distance", 1 SD = the situation<br>
I describe above, where you're half off the left edge<br>
of the screen and the target is half off the right edge<br>
(or vice versa). 1/2 SD would be half this distance.<br>
<br>
+/- : When you see this, it's usually in a formula like<br>
90 - distance +/- (Wind * Windfactor).<br>
That doesn't mean you can choose to add OR reduce your<br>
angle. You must only do one. So how do you decide whether to<br>
add to your angle or subtract from it? Just common sense.<br>
If wind is blowing up or towards the enemy, it helps your shot<br>
fly further. If you don't want the wind to blow it too far, you will<br>
raise your angle.  If the wind is blowing against your shot and<br>
making it land too close, then you just lower your angle. The<br>
lower your angle is, the further your shot will travel (up to<br>
a limit of angle 45, in both the real world and gunbound your<br>
maximum distance from a shot will always be at angle 45).<br>
<br>
Fixed power formula: This are formulas that use the same<br>
power (almost) all the time. You hit different parts of the<br>
screen by just changing your angle. For example<br>
with the banpao formula, using turtle or armor, you<br>
will use 3.0 bars of power. The actual power level in<br>
any fixed power formula DOES change a little depending<br>
on the enemy's distance. Like with banpao, for close<br>
shots you use 1 mm less than 3 bars. For far shots<br>
you need to add 1 mm (so shoot with 3.05). If you don't<br>
make these tiny power changes, then you will see that<br>
your shots don't land where you expect. Like the formula<br>
says angle 60 will land exactly 1.5 screens away, but if<br>
you use only 3.0 bars you will be a bit short of 1.5 screens.<br>
<br>
Fixed angle formula: For these types of formulas the angle<br>
you shoot at never changes, you just calculate power<br>
based on how far the enemy is and the wind.<br>
<br>
BJSL: This is a change angle, change power formula.<br>
You use different powers to control the distance of your<br>
shot. You change your angle to adjust for the wind<br>
blowing your shot too far or too short. I won't explain<br>
it yet.<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>
Ok enough terms, here's how to use formulas.<br>
<br>
Here's a very very typical formula that is the basis for dozens<br>
of formulas on my site:<br>
<br>
<b>2.4 fixed power formula</b><br>
<br>
Power: 2.4 bars fixed.<br>
Angle: 90 - distance +/- (wind * wind factor).<br>
30 parts per screen.<br>
<br>
Ok, we know the power is going to be 2.4 bars. It says 2.4<br>
fixed, which means always use 2.4 bars (although if you<br>
were paying attention you know you should use a bit<br>
less for close shots and a bit more for far shots).<br>
<br>
Now we just need to calculate the angle. To start, we see:<br>
Angle: 90-distance.<br>
<br>
distance is the same thing as "how many parts there are<br>
between you and the target". So if there are 30 parts per<br>
screen, then a target who is 1 screen away would be 30 parts<br>
distance. If they are half a screen away, then their distance<br>
would be 15 parts.<br>
<br>
So, if I see a target 2/3 screen away, and my formula<br>
says to use angle 90-distance... what is my shooting angle?<br>
Well, if it's 30 parts per screen, and the enemy is 2/3 of <br>
a screen away, you will say that the distance = 20. <br>
20 parts is 2/3 out of the full 30 part screen.<br>
Since the formula says to use angle 90-distance,<br>
then you would do 90-20. The answer is 70.<br>
Therefore your shooting angle is 70.<br>
<br>
So now we have a power (2.4) and an angle (70).<br>
70, 2.4 will hit an enemy who is 2/3 screen (20 parts)<br>
distance from you.<br>
<br>
But! We only just calculated shot in 0 wind. How to adjust when<br>
there's wind?<br>
<br>
This is a good time to introduce windcharts.<br>
Below is a basic windchart. The idea is simple.<br>
You multiply the number on the chart by the<br>
current wind's strength, and your answer will<br>
be some number. You then raise or lower your<br>
angle by that number. If wind is blowing towards<br>
the enemy, raise angle. If wind is blowing against<br>
you, lower angle. That's it. So for example if<br>
the wind in your game is blowing against you<br>
and a little bit up, (like at 10:00 o'clock) then<br>
look at this chart and look at what number<br>
is sitting by the 10:00 o'clock position. In<br>
this case it's .5 ... so you will multiply your<br>
current wind's strength by .5 to get the<br>
amount of angles to adjust.<br>
<br>
<img src="gunboundwtfchart.jpg"></img><br>
<br>
Ok so to recap, a typical formula works like this:<br>
<br>
1. memorize the angles and powers to hit different<br>
places in 0 wind. Usually the formula will tell you how<br>
to hit at LEAST half screen distance and 1 screen<br>
distance in 0 wind.<br>
<br>
2. Figure out whether you need to change angle or<br>
change power or both to hit different places on the<br>
screen, if the enemy isn't exactly at (for example)<br>
half screen or 1 screen.<br>
<br>
3. Now figure out how to adjust your angle or<br>
power for wind.<br>
<br>
4. You now should be able to calculate a good<br>
angle or power in any situation, as long as<br>
the formula is accurate and you did your<br>
math correctly and carefully measured how<br>
much distance is between you and the enemy.<br>
Oh, don't forget your formula is limited by<br>
power level, like 2.4 bars cannot shoot past 1<br>
screen distance, and if wind is blowing against<br>
you strongly, it can't even shoot 2/3 screen<br>
sometimes.<br>
<br>
Example formulas and how to read them:<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
<a href="fixed_60.php">Fixed 60</a><br>
<br>
Ok, this says "fixed 60" so you know the angle will always be<br>
60. Then you see by each bot a number, with "1/4 SD, 1/2 SD"<br>
etc. in columns. If you remember the terms listed earlier, that<br>
means 1/4 screen distance, 1/2 screen etc.<br>
If I wanted to use this chart in a practical way, I would memorize<br>
the 4 power levels for my favorite bot. It's not hard to remember<br>
4 things (plus power level). Then if I wanted to learn other bots<br>
I'd just remember whether a bot is a little lighter or a little<br>
heavier than my favorite bot. For example sate's shot is shown<br>
as being just 1 mm over turtle or armor's. So if you learn<br>
turtle or armor you should be able to use sate if you just<br>
remember "add 1 mm power".<br>
<br>
<a href="bjslangle808ro.jpg">BJSL 80</a><br>
<br>
So for this one, we have a similar setup on the right... showing<br>
1/4 SD, 1/2 SD, etc. You memorize the power levels for your<br>
chosen bot.  You know the angle will be 80 to start.<br>
<br>
Why is there no 1 SD power for armor and turtle? Because <br>
if mage must use full power to hit 1 screen away with angle 80,<br>
then armor and turtle (who have a heavier shot) can't hit 1<br>
screen away even with full power. Remember where I said<br>
earlier that most formulas are limited by power level? Like<br>
2.4 can't be used past 1 screen distance? This formula is<br>
limited by the angle... angle 80 cannot be used past<br>
1 screen distance either (and for armor/turtle not even<br>
1 SD).<br>
<br>
So we can see from the chart that if you wanted to hit<br>
1/2 screen in 0 wind, the angle is 80 and the power is<br>
2.9 for armor or turtle. Now what if there is wind?<br>
For wind adjustment, the windchart on the left has wind<br>
factors just like the example I showed earlier.<br>
You multiply wind strength by wind factor and you<br>
get a number. You then raise or lower your angle<br>
by that number. So this is how BJSL works... you<br>
are going to change both your angle and your<br>
power... power is changed only to control the<br>
distance your shot will travel before you adjust<br>
for wind, and angle is changed only to compensate<br>
for the wind's effect.<br>
<br>
Last example. If you can get this chart you<br>
can get any formula probably.<br>
<br>
<a href="backshot.htm">2.5 backshot</a><br>
<br>
From the formula we can see <br>
<br>
60 - (wind power X wind index) + (distance) = shooting angle<br>
<br>
Shooting power: 2.5 bars<br>
---------<br>
<br>
So, starting angle is 60, then you subtract some number.<br>
The number you subtract will be the result of<br>
(wind power X wind index).<br>
<br>
You use the windchart shown to calculate your number<br>
and then subtract the answer from 60.<br>
<br>
So, let's say wind is 10 directly left or right (to use the<br>
chart when facing the other way, you just use the same<br>
rules but backwards). The chart says to use 0.5 as a wind<br>
factor, so 10 * 0.5 = 5. <br>
<br>
Subtract 5 from 60 to get 55. That's the basic<br>
angle after wind adjustment (but before distance<br>
adjustment).<br>
<br>
Distance adjustment: You just add the distance to<br>
your target (measured in parts) to your current angle.<br>
So the current angle we calculated was 55. From the<br>
formula we see: "Take half screen to be 15 parts. "<br>
<br>
So if the enemy is half a screen away, we would add<br>
15 angles. So 55+15 = 70.<br>
<br>
So in theory the shot is angle 70, 2.5 bars. BUT -<br>
It just happens that if boomer is using a backshot,<br>
your maximum distance will come always from angle 66.<br>
If you try angles higher than 66, your shot will still land<br>
at the same distance as an angle 66 shot (or even closer).<br>
So using angle 70 would be useless. Where on the formula<br>
does it warn you about this? It doesn't exactly, and that's<br>
why you must practice and learn from experience what<br>
the limitations of a formula are. That is why using a<br>
formula is not "just like using an aimbot" (which is<br>
what some stupid people try to say about using<br>
formulas). <br>
<br>
You can also sometimes overcome the limitations of<br>
your formula with a little brains. If the enemy is a hair<br>
over 1 screen distance and you're using the 2.4 formula,<br>
and you already know that 60, 2.5 will be 1 screen distance...<br>
then it's easy to guess that 60, 2.55 will work for just past<br>
1 screen distance. Or if wind is blowing against you and you<br>
know your shot won't reach 1 screen, you can feel or guess<br>
how much power to add to make the shot go 1 screen. Then<br>
you can keep using your formula with this new slight change<br>
in power.<br>
