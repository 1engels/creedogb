<body>CreeDo's note: By now this is old info, and Kalsiddon was MAJORLY nerfed<br>
so that his damage is much lower and hits are much less reliable.<br>
<p>
Here's basic info for j.frog and kalsiddon:<br>
<br>
KAL:<br>
<br>
The most powerful of the 2 new bots, it looks like bigfoot but plays<br>
mostly like turtle. It's built to be used with high angles, but can also do<br>
big damage at close range if you know the trick. It has good movement,<br>
good angle range (sort of like nak's old angle range), and high damage.<br>
Defense seems weak, but everything in GB:WC does too much damage<br>
so that doesn't matter much.<br>
<br>
How the missiles work: All of your shots work the same way:<br>
First, you fire a big bomb.<br>
At the top of the big bomb's arc it will split up into smaller missiles.<br>
This happens always at the top of the shot's arc, so if you do a weak<br>
shot that travels only 1 inch, the shot will split after going about half<br>
an inch. If you do a long high angle shot, it will happen after a couple of<br>
seconds when the shot's as high as it can get.<br>
Even after the bomb splits, a little tracer (like a. sate's tracer)<br>
keeps flying along the shot's normal path and will hit the ground.<br>
The missiles that are released move in a weird<br>
circular pattern. They spin around in loops for a second before homing<br>
in on the tracer. So wherever the tracer falls, the missiles will hit IF<br>
they've spent enough time in the air doing loopy spastic spins.<br>
If they don't have enough time in the air, what happens is their weird<br>
spinning animation causes them to crash into the ground or some<br>
other obstacle (like you) before they end up hitting the target.<br>
<br>
Shot 1: 2 missiles<br>
Shot 2: 4 missiles<br>
SS: Many missiles<br>
<br>
Typical shot 1 damage: ~150-200<br>
Typical shot 2 damage: ~230-350<br>
Typical SS damage: ~400-500<br>
<br>
Strategy: You know how there are 2 ways to hit an SS with turtle? The<br>
timebomb and the skybomb? Well Kal sort of works the same way, he<br>
can get full damage from all of the missiles using 2 methods.<br>
High angle/skybomb style: Just use a high angle shot with plenty of<br>
airtime, and the missiles will have time to do a few loops and then<br>
home in on your tracer. You basically shoot the same way you<br>
would with turtle's shot 2.<br>
Close range/timebomb style: If you can get the shot to reach<br>
the top of its arc inside the enemy's body, then the missiles will<br>
all explode inside their body for massive damage. This is stronger<br>
than the high angle method, but also harder to do. You must be using<br>
a positive angle (higher than 0) and it's easiest with low, flat shots.<br>
The super easy method is to get right inside the enemy and do a<br>
shot with 0 power, which does some damage to you also. It's harder,<br>
but possible, to do it up to half a screen away. This is a good time<br>
to learn your long range shotguns.<br>
<br>
Delay-wise, kal is a little worse than average, but the SS is pretty strong<br>
and worth using, and duals don't have more than the usual 'average'<br>
dual delay (he's not like armor).<br>
<br>
Your angle range is nice and you should have no trouble getting<br>
true angle with kal's good climbing.  You need it to make those<br>
high angle shots.<br>
<br>
Kal also ruins angle easily, usually by accident. The missiles may<br>
still be moving in a weird way and hit in front of or even under the enemy.<br>
<br>
You can use kal's shots through a nado, the missiles for some reason<br>
still home in pretty well.<br>
<br>
The big bombs pass through the target's body, they aren't solid until<br>
they hit land or blow up inside the enemy's body. If you shoot through<br>
their body into the land and the bombs don't get a chance to split, you<br>
do puny damage.<br>
<br>
Formula shooting:<br>
If you use fixed power 30-parts-per-screen shooting, (aka cbchui-style<br>
shooting, similar to armor 2.4) then kal will use power levels ranging<br>
from 2.55 (half screen shots) to 2.65 (1 full screen). I haven't confirmed<br>
if those numbers are perfect but they're close. If you use banpao-style<br>
shooting (20 parts per screen) then you'll want power levels like this:<br>
3.1 for half screen or closer. 3.15 for 3/4 screen. 3.2 for 1 screen.<br>
3.25 for 1.5 screens.<br>
<br>
Fixed 70 shooting (untested):<br>
1/2 SD = 2.25, <br>
3/4 SD = 2.75,<br>
1 SD = 3.2,<br>
1.5 SD = 3.9<br>
<br>
<br>
J. FROG:<br>
<br>
Frog is a strategic bot, low damage and somewhat difficult to use, but<br>
great at angle ruining, bunge, and winning delay. Think of it as another<br>
version of JD. The defense, attack, and delay are a bit better than JD's,<br>
but the tradeoff is it's harder to use and the SS sorta sucks.<br>
<br>
How the shots work: Frog's shots travel through the air normally (BTW,<br>
they're very very light) then start 'walking' as soon as they hit the<br>
ground, sort of like Raon's SS shot. But they don't explode when they<br>
touch an enemy, instead they keep walking. After walking for about<br>
3 seconds, they explode. Your goal is to time your shot to land <br>
near the enemy, so that after 3 seconds it's inside the enemy when it blows.<br>
When the shot explodes, it makes a pretty nice hole like mage shot 1.<br>
It's very good at ruining angle since the shot can be timed to explode<br>
anywhere in front of their feet or underneath them.<br>
If it explodes right on them, you'll do a bit of damage.. not a ton,<br>
usually 150-210. Important: Frog's shot 1 always walks left when it hits<br>
the floor, and shot 2 always walks right. So if you're facing right and use<br>
shot 1, then it will hit the ground and immediately start moving backwards<br>
(towards you). But if you're facing the other way it strolls forward.<br>
The amount of walking is based on time, not distance. It <br>
always blows up after about 3 seconds of walking. It has unlimited<br>
climbing and can cling to the underside of ledges, so you need to<br>
think of a lot of factors when trying to time the shot. If the enemy has<br>
flat ground in front of or behind them, the timing is easy, but if they<br>
have a hill or (worst of all) a little ledge near them, you must remember<br>
that it moves up and down a bit slower than it moves horizontally.<br>
The SS works differently from 1 and 2, a bit. It just keeps walking<br>
for a long time, and when it passes through the enemy it does damage<br>
(sort of like how grub SS will do damage as it passes through them).<br>
The trick to the SS is to try to hit an enemy on a floating speck of land.<br>
Then the SS will walk in circles around that speck and pass through<br>
the target several times for very high damage. The other trick is<br>
to look for a situation where there are 2 enemies near each other with<br>
low life. Then you can walk the SS through both for a DK.<br>
<br>
Shot 1: Walking blob (always walks left after hitting the ground)<br>
Shot 2: Walking blob (always walks right after hitting the ground)<br>
SS: Big walking blob (walks in the direction it's fired)<br>
<br>
Typical shot 1 damage: ~150-210<br>
Typical shot 2 damage: ~150-210<br>
Typical SS damage: ~400-500<br>
<br>
Strategy: Obviously remember which way shots 1 and 2 walk. Then<br>
try to aim your shot to land a bit behind the enemy or a bit in front<br>
of them depending on which direction you're facing and which shot<br>
you're using. How far you land the shot in front of or behind the enemy<br>
depends on how much climbing the shot has to do. Climbing up or down<br>
slopes means the shot has less horizontal walking to do before it<br>
explodes, so you plant the shot a bit closer to the target. If the<br>
land is pretty flat, I plant the shot about 1/7th of a screen away from<br>
the intented target - about 4 parts out of a 30-part screen. Sometimes<br>
it's very hard to time the shot because of slopes and ledges. Always<br>
try to pick the shot that will result in the easiest timing - if there's<br>
a big slope or overhang in front of the enemy, then aim to land the<br>
shot behind them instead. Basically always aim for the side of the<br>
enemy that has the flattest land. With duals, you want the first shot<br>
to blow up a little late because it will make a hole and 'slow down'<br>
the second shot so that it blows up right in the middle of them.<br>
<br>
For the SS, try to look for situations where the enemy is on a speck of<br>
land, and if you're lucky/skilled enough to hit that speck you'll get<br>
great damage. Also look for DK opportunities with it. Otherwise, screw it.<br>
It's nearly useless.<br>
<br>
Remember the light weight of the shot, it's lighter even than<br>
boomer's but doesn't move in the same funky way that boomer's shot<br>
does. It's affected by wind normally. Also remember that your delay<br>
is super low, the lowest in the game. I think both shot 1 and 2 have<br>
the same delay or very nearly the same, since they both do the<br>
same damage and are pretty much identical. The delay for frog's shots<br>
is like 670 or something. Look for chances to steal turns. Unfortunately,<br>
when I played frog, some bug showed my delay as always 0. But<br>
I didn't actually have 0 delay. So I can't say for sure what the real<br>
shot delay is, just keep an eye on the turn list and look for chances<br>
to steal turns where other bots can't.<br>
<br>
Weather affects the shot when it blows up, not when it lands, so<br>
don't be scared to use force/lightning/thor with frog.<br>
<br>
Once your shot 1 or 2 hits the ground, it ignores tornados. It moves<br>
through the nado like all other shots do when it's airborne, but forgets<br>
about the nado once it lands, so if there's a nado in front of the enemy,<br>
you can almost aim the shot normally. It'll start to wrap around the<br>
nado, then walk normally if it hits the ground before exiting the nado.<br>
<br>
Be careful in melee situations. If you get your shots backwards you can<br>
send the shot walking back into you. Also watch out that you don't try<br>
to just tap close range shots into an enemy. The shot needs 3 seconds<br>
on the ground no matter what. If you're a few inches from the target,<br>
you can just tap your shot and let it land right in front of you, then<br>
walk the short distance between you and the enemy before exploding. But<br>
if you're forced to shoot them at super close range, you must aim to put<br>
the shot behind them and let it walk backwards into them.<br>
<br>
Formula shooting:<br>
If you use fixed power 30-parts-per-screen shooting, (aka cbchui-style<br>
shooting, similar to armor 2.4) then frog will use power levels ranging<br>
from 1.95 (half screen shots) to 2.1 (1 full screen). I haven't confirmed<br>
if those numbers are perfect but they're close. If you use banpao-style<br>
shooting (20 parts per screen) then you'll probably want to use<br>
between 2.5 and 2.6 bars of power (untested).<br><br>
