<body>hmm okay , where to start this off? yeah 32* is the usual low angle which people use <br>
to shoot with nak. because it shoots at a low angle, it hits them in their weak spot, <br>
doing the most dmg. 32 degree angle is very useful because wind doesn't affect it much, <br>
making it quicker to calculate rather a higher angle. However, up and down wins affect <br>
it a lot, but while left and right wind not much. <br>
<p>
all the methods i make / use i use the power bar as an aiming guide. why? it is a <br>
practical way while always being accurate and uhhh i cant split the screen into 30 <br>
parts in my head?!?!?! <br>
<p>
always line the back of your mobile with the beginning of the power bar (click <br>
and hold right click and drag into place) <br>
<p>
32* degree shots <br>
1/4 power bar : .5 power <br>
1/2 power bar : 1.1 power <br>
3/4 power bar : 1.3 power <br>
4/4 power bar : 1.6 power <br>
till the edge : 2.0 power <br>
<p>

<p>
If the guy is inbetween two of those angles, just add or subtract a little power <br>
accordingly. <br>
<p>
___________________________________ <br>
<p>
if the enemy is beyond your point of view, drag your mobile to the edge of the screen <br>
and use the following to aim by: <br>
<p>
to the 4/4 power bar : 2.1 power <br>
1 full screen : 2.4 power <br>
<p>

<p>

<p>
<p>
another thing i must talk about. if the enemy is on different levels, you have to <br>
shoot differently too. here i have shown some different levels.<br>
<p>
<img src="kexericarmor3.jpg"><br>
<p>
the main 3 levels you will be usually shooting from are shown below. shooting from <br>
one level to another is each ~.1 or a little higher power. <br>
so..... <br>
shooting from level 1 to 2.... change power ~.1 or little more power <br>
shooting from level 1 to 3..... change power ~.2 or a little more power <br>
etc etc. <br>
<p>
showing example:<br>
<p>
<img src="kexericarmor4.jpg"><br>
<p>
the guy is a little higher than me,... therefore i use .1 more power than i <br>
regulary use. so i would use 1.2 or 1.25 power.<br>
<p>

<p>
wind.... <br>
i don't really have a "REAL" windchart written up or made.... <br>
i usually estimate how much to add or whatever but i will give my words. <br>
<p>
tailwind -> <br>
doesn't affect shot much, if it is super high like 20+, maybe subtract ~.1 <br>
or less power <br>
<p>
wind against you <- <br>
same as tail, doesnt affect much , but as the winds get really high like 20+, <br>
AND they are really far away... depending how far away they are add about .1 or .2 power <br>
<p>
up wind ^ <br>
this affects shot a lot. i think about 5 wind is .1 power? something like that. <br>
i think when its like 20 up wind, i subtract ~.4 power. <br>
<p>
down wind \/ <br>
affects shot much too. i think 5 wind down is almost .1 power.... and maybe <br>
like 20 downwind is like change .4 power too.... maybe a reasonable formula <br>
to say is change .1 power for every 5 wind? (not confirmed, i might try this out <br>
and change my guide a little later) <br>
<p>
-------<br>
Creedo's note - Soyabean and phantomD, who specialize in formulas, have added<br>
some useful info or corrections below:<br>
------------<br>
phantomD:<br>
Just some information: <br>
<p>
For a perfect tail wind , the factor is about 75/1000 for 1 screen distance, <br>
let's say if the wind is 20, you have to adjust 0.15 power. Therefore it's about <br>
0.04 power to adjust for each 5 wind . Always remember, if your target's distance <br>
is 1/4 of screen, the power to adjust needs to be multiplied by 0.5. <br>
<p>
For a wind that goes against you perfectly , the factor is about 90/1000 for 1 <br>
screen distance, let's say if the wind is 20, you have to adjust 0.18 power. <br>
Therefore it's 0.045 for each 5 wind . <br>
<p>
For a perfect up-wind , its factor is about 12/1000 for 1 screen distance, that <br>
means, if the wind is 20, you have to adjust 0.24, each 5 wind = 0.06 power to adjust. <br>
<p>
For a perfect down-wind , its factor is 10/1000 for 1 screen distance, that means, <br>
if the wind is 20, you have to adjust 0.2, each 5 wind = 0.05 power to adjust.<br>
<p>
Soyabean:<br>
0 angle tail wind is -0.1, not 0.15 <br>
<p>
0 angle against wind is +0.2 <br>
<p>
90 up is -0.2 <br>
<p>
90 down is ard +0.25 <br>
<p>
and for lesser distance of cuz u gotta use a smaller power change.. some good things <br>
to note that the winds that affect u the strongest are those ard the +45 tail wind <br>
region and those -45 head iwnd region.. max power change ard there can be up to 0.35... <br>
weakest wind regions are those ard +45 head wind and -45 tail wind where highest power <br>
change usually is ard 0.1... down wind max is ard 0.3 and up wind is max at ard 0.25<br>
