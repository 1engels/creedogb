<h1>Basic Shooting Strategy</h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
Turtle's main weapon is his shot 2. It takes about four of them to kill most enemies, which means
two good duals. Shot 1 is important in certain situations too, when you can
use the lower delay to get two turns in a row, or when you don't have a good angle for shot 2.
Learning the SS is nice, but optional. If you master shot 2, you'll be a big threat.
<p>
So, if your main goal is to hit with four shot 2's... what do you need to know?
Well, first you need to know that not every shot 2 will hit for full damage. The wide spirals
(aka "spins") made by shot 2 are so far apart that at their widest point, they will completely wrap
around an enemy's body without touching him.

You need to shoot a certain way
to be sure that the shot is coming together when it reaches the enemy.
Then you get full damage (240-300 for a solid hit). To make that happen,
use these shooting methods:
<h2>Shooting modes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shotgun - you aim directly at the enemy and shoot with max power.<br>
The range is limited to about 1/4 screen and you usually need a hill behind you<br>
to get a low enough angle, so it's not available any time you want it.
<li>High angle shot - you give the shot lots of airtime by firing with a high angle and<br>
enough power to keep the shot flying through the air about 2.5 seconds. Then the<br>
shot stops spiraling and comes together into 1 powerful stream. Probably the safest<br>
way to get full shot 2 damage when shotguns aren't available.
<li>Short fork - if the enemy is close to you, and you can't get a low enough<br>
angle to shotgun them, you can use low power and a highish angle to cause<br>
your shot to spread out only one time, then come together and hit them.
<li>Long fork - this is a challenging alternative to using high angle shots.<br>
You must control the airtime of the shot carefully so that it spins 4 or 5 times,<br>
then comes together to hit for full damage before it can spread out again.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Your shooting plan:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, shotgun the enemy with shot 2. You get full damage for 
no effort. You don't need to calculate the shot or think hard about the power or angle.
You don't have to look at the wind. You can drag the shot with full power
and get your shot off in half a second, which improves your chances of 
beating someone else's delay. In fact, I usually will dual when I get the chance to
shotgun... unless I'm convinced that I could live longer by saving delay and not dualing.
There's really no reason NOT to shotgun, as long as you know you're aiming at
the right target (i.e. the biggest threat or the enemy who needs to die before
they can shoot again). Some dumbasses will try to tell you that shotgunning is for
noobs and is a weak way to play gunbound. Don't listen to them, they just say
that because they hate to see someone have a 100% guaranteed, full damage
shot against them. They'd rather see you do a foolish, unnecessary high angle or
fork shot and miss. Always shotgun when it's available and ignore the whiners.
<li>If you can't get a good angle to hit with a shotgun, but you have
an enemy who is very close to you, you can use a short fork to easily get
high damage with no effort. This is another shot where power, angle,
and wind aren't that important. It's so easy that you can usually 
fork instead of a shotgun, if you want. Shotguns are a little
more damaging and reliable, but you should know the short fork
anyway because often you cannot get a low enough angle to shotgun.
I'll cover how to fork properly later.
<li>If the enemy is too far to shotgun or fork, use a high angle shot. There are several
formulas available for doing this. These formulas use a fixed power shot,
which is important for Turtle. The more power you have when shooting with
a high angle, the more airtime the shot will have, and by giving the shot
lots of airtime, you can get shot 2 to converge in the air (so you
don't have to worry about getting full damage). About 2.2 bars of power is the minimum
to get the shot to converge properly for full damage. High angling, no matter
what formulas you choose to learn, is important for
Turtle. In many situations you will NOT have an easy shotgun or fork
shot available, and if you don't use a high power, high angle shot...
then you have to work very hard (or get lucky) to get the shot to 'fork' the enemy.
If you learn nothing else in this entire guide, learn the high angle shots.
It's Turtle's "main shot" and should be used as much as possible unless
there's an easier alternative.
<li>Sometimes you just can't use a high angle shot because the land is too flat.
In those situations, knowing how to use Turtle's long fork shots can be very useful.
It's difficult to control the airtime of the shot perfectly and get good damage
with Turtle's fork, but it can be learned with time and practice. It can save your life
when you can't get a high angle and there's just no way to keep your shot in the
air long enough to get it to converge. It's also a nice way to show off.
Pros know it's a hard shot to calculate.
<li> Occasionally you will be stuck on very flat land, so even a fork shot isn't guaranteed.
In those situations, I like to walk towards the nearest useful slope and fire a shot 1
at my enemy. You could just fire shot 1 behind you to create the slope, but
I think hitting with a weak shot 1 is better than wasting a turn making angle,
in most cases. Eventually the enemy will shoot at you and will probably damage
the land to create the slope you need, and after 2 turns you should be
able to walk far enough to get a good angle anyway.
<li>SS - as I said, it's not necessary to know SS to be good.
But in some rare situations, there will be matches you cannot win
without using the SS. If the opponent's next shot kills you, and
you have no items left or it's item lock... and you
absolutely need at least 400 damage to kill them... knowing SS will be
the difference between a win and a loss. The SS delay is also lower than 
a dual, but does the same damage. Early on in solo games, there
are lots of duals fired in an attempt to end someone quickly before they
even get a chance to shoot. It's very useful to be able to do
500-600 damage with lower delay than all the enemies who fired duals.
You could weaken an enemy enough for a teammate to kill them, or else finish
off an already weakened enemy... then you get to shoot AGAIN before 
everyone else. So at the very least,
a Turtle player should learn easy 0 wind SSes and keep the SS in mind as
an option to beat the delay of someone else's dual. If you choose never to
learn the SS, you can still be a good Turtle, but you're robbing yourself
of some fun and you might lose a few games you could have won.
