<h1>Boomer's weapons:</h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<h2>Shot 1</h2><br>
A super-low-delay shot 1 that also happens to do pretty decent damage. 
Arguably the best shot 1 in the game.  It isn't used much because boomer's shot 
2 also kicks ass.  You can use shot 1 to beat someone's delay and get 2 turns
in a row on them (or make sure they don't get two turns in a row on you). You
can also use it to kill an enemy with only a little life, which gets you the
kill and saves some delay.<br>
<h3>Delay: 730<br>
Typical damage: 150</h3>
<p>
<h2>Shot 2</h2><br>
A very user-friendly shot 2, you fire four projectiles but they all 
follow the same path and stay clustered, so it might as well be a single shot. 
It also drills quite a ways through dirt.<br>
<h3>Delay: 880<br>
Typical damage: 250</h3>
<p>
<h2>SS</h2><br>
This shot requires 1.8 seconds of airtime (I think) before it 'opens up'. 
If you have used armor or turtle's SS you know what I'm talking about.  If you 
don't keep the shot airborne long enough then it simply hits the enemy for a 
crappy bit of damage (maybe 250ish).  If it stays airborne long enough it stops 
for a split second, flashes, and transforms into a golden boomerang that can 
inflict 400-600 damage depending on how perfectly centered and 'clean' the hit 
is.  It causes a little bit more splash damage than your other shots, which 
means a very near miss might be good for 200-300. What makes this SS really
awesome is the fact that boomer's slow-moving shot animation guarantees that
your SS will open up for almost any lobbed shot, as long as you aren't just
shotgunning it. You can get it to open with as little as .8 bars of power,
less if there's upwards wind.<br>   
<h3>Delay: 1280<br>
Typical damage: 450+</h3>
