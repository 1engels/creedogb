<p>
dont worry i wont take much time  <br>
<p>
Lets start.. <br>
<p>
Shot 1: <br>
<p>
Its useful when there is a pixel infront of you <br>
your angles goes up and you wont hit the pixel.. <br>
and its damage is good enough for shot 1  <br>

<p>
<p>
Shot 2: <br>
<p>
Sometimes when you see a guy using mamoth he duals and he makes 350 or something like this damage and -OMG WEAK- .. <br>
with shot 2 you can decrease his defense and make more damage to the enemy <br>
try to dual after -15 def. with thor you can make 500+ damage <br>
the thing that is bad about shot 2 the angles goes down so when there is a pixel just use shot 1  <br>
<p>

<p>
<p>
SS Shot: <br>
<p>
Well SS is same as shot 2 so no need to explain only little more damage it does and the delay is more. <br>
thats all i can say about SS.. <br>
<p>
Mamoth's Life: <br>
<p>
when you start a solo game if you are the last one who will shoot <br>
if u got hit by 2 duals you still live you wont die .. <br>
Mamoth has a long life and you wont die so fast if they dt you from first turn you will get a turn atleast before u die  <br>
<p>
ok now we go for the angles and powers.. <br>
<p>
well i use for wind 0 50 2.15 for 1 SD and 70 1.3 for 1/4 SD and 70 1.9 for 2/4 SD and 60 2.0 for 3/4 SD <br>
<p>
Here are more powers and angles for wind 0. <br>
<p>
80: 2.0 1/4 SD , 2.8 2/4 SD , 3.15 3/4 SD , 3.65 4/4 SD <br>
<p>
70: 1.3 1/4 SD , 1.9 2/4 SD , 2.3 3/4 SD , 2.7 1 SD <br>
<p>
60: 1.2 1/4 SD , 1.6 2/4 SD , 2.0 3/4 SD , 2.3 4/4 SD <br>
