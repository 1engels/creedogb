<body>Become a nak pro from SAGE <br>
I am cirtenly not the best nak, but im decent and i learned some very useful aiming <br>
techniques in just a few days of practicing. <br>
<p>
Nak's shot 2 is heavier then amours shot 2 but since Nak's ball digs underground, <br>
it becomes roughly the same shot. <br>
<p>
Your old amour formulas work quite nicly with nak <br>
<p>
-2.1 bar 70 angle is half screen (on zero wind) <br>
-3 bar 70 goes full screen (also zero wind) <br>
-2.5 bar goes about 3/4's screen (you guessed it  ) <br>
I like to use those 2 shots as bench marks when i shoot with nak long range, <br>
and if it not exactly half screen or full screen it is easy to adjust. <br>
<p>
If you are 1/4th screen or closer you should be able too feel out the shots, <br>
and if you cant then give up and go cry in the woods. The best advice i can give <br>
you from my experiences with nak is that when you are shooting short range you should<br>
 make your angle 60 or above. preferably 70 or higher. this will make your shot go <br>
straight up and down on your opponant, and will help tons when you are dualing  <br>
<p>
High angles also come in handy with nak, but it is better to stick with the <br>
70 angle shots. use high angles when you dont have enough space to land the other <br>
type shotz. ange 85 is about a half screen (2shot) angle 79 is full screen 2 shot, <br>
so from there it is easy to calculate 80 angle 81 ect. <br>
<p>
Wind adjustment is give or take the exact same as amour so read one of the amour <br>
guides cuz i dont feel like writing up a wind guide right now cuz i just smoked pot <br>
and its 3:45 a.m. But basicly what you will learn to do is still use the 70 angle shots,<br>
but adjust your angle and keep the same power (sound familiar?) but hold on, its not <br>
that easy, when you are going againt the wind you will need to add a lil more power <br>
because the ball will not dig as much because it will be going as fast, the harder <br>
the wind againt you the more you will have to compensate, when you are going with <br>
the wind just take some power off. there is no true formula for how much to take off, <br>
but its no biggy, just use your judgement cuz its not that hard. and if your wondering <br>
why im rambling on it is cuz im damn blazed <br>
<p>
It is much easier to shoot against the wind then with it. if the wind is over 15 going <br>
with me, i dont even bother. <br>
<p>
Dont be afraid to use nak's one shot, but with the info i just gave you, you wint <br>
need to use the meathod of useing one shot first turn, then subtracting power, cuz <br>
thats just stupid. use 1 shot when you know your 2 shot wont hit. and you should <br>
know when you cant land a 2 shot in then or not. if you think you cant 2 shot them, <br>
then dont try, cuz it will just waste your delay. Here are some 1 shot methods: <br>
-70 angle - 3.3 bars is full screen (on zero wind, you know the routine) <br>
-60 angle - 2.9 bars is full screen (do i even need to say zero wind?) <br>
-76 angle - Full is full screen (yesyes, zero wind again) <br>
Adjust your angle the same way you would with the 2 shot. <br>
Overall Nak's 1 shot is by far the worst one shot in the game, it has massive delay, <br>
very low damage, and little bunge. but if you wanna become nak pro you gotta know one <br>
shot or your fu%ked  <br>
<p>
SS works the same way as the one shot exept it goes through walls, great angle butser <br>
or Ks shot  but big delay for a small damage shot, use when you are killing, or have <br>
absolutly no other way of shooting. and you almost always can shotgun it so please <br>
do so. Nobody will call you a noob <br>
<p>
Well that just about wraps it up but before i end this thing, ill give you some advice <br>
that will by useful: <br>
- When using nak you have to be more crative with your shots then other bots, always <br>
look for a hole to jump into for deadly 2 shots. just before you shoot imagine the shot, <br>
and other possibilities, you can shoot. <br>
-The shot 2 goes through bodies unless it has already gone underground, so if your <br>
played solo, its nice to have a dead body to hinde behind and shoot through  <br>
-It may take a couple days to master this stuff, but once you do you can really <br>
impress your friends. you will find yourslef making shots that to you are easy and <br>
everyone in the room is saying "OMG nak pro..OMG, kick after this game!" <br>
- i cant say this enough: if you wanna be pro with nak you gotta be crative with <br>
your shots, hit the shots that other pleayers dont even see. <br>
<p>
Gosh i hope people read this <br>
<p>
If you find anything wrong with it please tell me because i would like to know <br>
for my own sake. <br>
<p>
Once again, i am not the best nak, im not one of the top 50 naks..well maby i am..<br>
i dno.. that beside the point, i know this isnt all the shots, but i would like <br>
to share with you many shots that work most of the time.<br>
