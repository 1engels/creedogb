<h1>Simple Avatar Rating Calculator</h1>
<h2>Created by MrLogic and CreeDo</h2>
<p>
<br>
This form calculates the value of your avatar using a math formula.<br>
It only looks at the three most important stats - attack, defense, and hearts.<br>
The higher the number you come up with, the better your avatar setup is.<br>
A good setup will result in a number that is close to 3.<br>
If an outfit doesn't boost one of these stats, type "0" in the blank for it.<br>
<p>
General advice: Defense + hearts are best. If your bot has over 1000 HP,<br>
focus on hearts, if under 1000 focus on defense. Attack is good, but hearts+defense are a little better<br>
because they're useful even if you can't hit. Also, lightning and JD already get a little attack bonus... <br>
their 'aftershock' ignores the enemy's defense rating. So they don't really need high attack.<br>
Maxing the other stats like bunge, shield, etc. is fun but not as good. Max bunge can be very strong <br>
with the right bot (bigfoot) and the right maps (thin land maps) and the right items (shovels, dual).<br>
It's also good for frog since it boosts the strength of frog SS and enlarges frog's big angle-ruining holes.<br>
