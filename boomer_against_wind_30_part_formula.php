Power and distance points for "boomer against wind lobb <br>
if u read the boomer against the wind lobbing formula, by honghong translated by <br>
soyabean, only 4 power points are provided. i have used the power measurement formula <br>
from the guide (which is (-1.4 * (distance^2) + [4.21(distance)] + 0.5375) to come up <br>
with some power points.. <br>
<p>
the originaly translated guide is 
<a href="boomer_against_wind_lob_formula.txt">here</a>.<br>
<p>
for those who never heard of this formula before, it is: <br>
<p>
this is to hit against wind that is too hard to full hook, which comes in VERY useful. <br>
angle : 50 - (wind strength * wind factor) <br>
power is judged below, according to distance. power is not changed, only angle is. <br>
btw you dont split your screen into sections for this one. <br>
just subtract wind x wind factor from 50. <br>
<p>
WIND CHART for wind factors is here (by CreeDo) : <br>

I was hoping to make this formula work better instead of estimating numbers.<br>
