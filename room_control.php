<p>
I. Making a room and getting people to play in it.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
First click "create" to create a room.  The first thing you should look at is the<br>
room number.  High numbered rooms tend to get very few visitors, and so it's <br>
harder to get a game to start.  You want a low number.  What's considered a low<br>
number?  In avatar off servers, which are quite busy, I'm happy with any room<br>
lower than 300 or so.  I might even keep one in the low 300's during busy times.<br>
If you get anything below 200 you have a good room and should keep it.  If you<br>
get a room in the 500+ range, exit and try making a room again.  Very high room<br>
numbers are almost useless.  In avatar off, you need even lower room numbers<br>
because the servers are much less crowded.<br>
<p>
Note that if you make a room and it seems too good to be true, it probably is.<br>
If you make a room with a low number like "14" that's because the room number is<br>
really 1,014.  For some reason gunbound doesn't show the full room number.<br>
<p>
If you have a room and don't wanna give it up, and want people to join, ask a<br>
friend or two to join and help.  If you have 4 ppl rdy, and need 2 more, it's <br>
a lot easier than having 1 and needing 5 more.  Also, if you have REALLY nice<br>
friends, have them ready on team B.  Then you can at least practice 1v1 if it<br>
looks like nobody will come.  Also, with a friend watching over the room, one<br>
of you can go out into a main gunbound chatroom and ask people to join.  It<br>
actually works.<br>
<p>
Lastly, if you're desperate, you can try to attract people with a title.  <br>
Sometimes making a friendly or funny title works ("Friendly room", "All welcome",<br>
"free beer", "wand team all noob", etc etc).  What doesn't seem to work is <br>
"Ready in 5 or kick" (encourages people to stay and not ready, just to piss <br>
you off) or "Rdy or fuk off" (same problem).  You can also offer items, though <br>
it's considered bad form to offer an item and not pay up.  Very few people are<br>
fooled anymore by "win = gold armour" but a few might try "Impress = Item" or<br>
"Noob win x 2 = item".  If you still can't get a game to start even with <br>
decent conditions, consider lowering the game from 4:4 to 3:3 or from 3:3 to<br>
2:2.  If you have four on your side, ask one to leave or go over.  If you're <br>
ultimately desperate and nobody is staying because your team has high ranked <br>
players, you can always change to the other team and sacrifice a win just to <br>
get the game started.  Don't ask a friend to join the other team just so he <br>
can quit or TK though... that's lame.  Play serious if you switch teams.<br>
<p>
II. Controlling a room once you have the key.<br>
----------------------------------------------<br>
<p>
When you're almost ready to start, it can get painful.  Try to encourage <br>
people to ready up once they join, but don't be a nazi cock about it. If you<br>
ask them politely to ready up, they might just do it.  If you say "I hate these<br>
stupid pricks who join and don't ready, ready or fuk off you moron", they will<br>
probably say "fuk you kick me" and make you waste a kick.  KEEPING YOUR KICKS<br>
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ROOM CONTROL.  You only get five.  If someone <br>
isn't going to play,  try to get them to leave without using a kick.  If you're <br>
forced to use a kick then do it but don't make a big deal about it and encourage <br>
other lamers to force you to use more.  <br>
<p>
For example, a guy switches to your team without asking.  <br>
First ask politely "_________, go back over please".  Then ask again<br>
using /m "Sorry, we're full.  Please go back to the other team.".  It helps if<br>
you know how to say it in spanish sometimes ("cambia, por favor.").  If they<br>
whine a bit like "but I wannnaaa stay on thiss teaaam", that's not bad - that<br>
means they are at least human and willing to talk about it.  By being cool and<br>
friendly about it, you can usually get them to change back, i.e. "haha <br>
we can't fit you because we're all friends.  Sorry!  Maybe next time."  Some<br>
people are a special breed and do not respond to friendliness, rudeness, or <br>
anything in between.  They pretend they're blind and don't speak english, they<br>
ignore everything you say, they just sit on your team (apparently waiting for<br>
they kick).  When that happens, you're forced to do it, just quietly do it.  <br>
Don't comment about it.  The more you talk about it and make a big deal about <br>
it, the more likely it is some other guy will decide to teamswitch because he<br>
thinks it's funny that you get worked up or angry over it.  People like that<br>
are assholes, but it's possible to avoid wasting a kick on them if they see <br>
that nobody is going to feed their need for attention in your room.<br>
<p>
Basically stay cool, always ask people to leave before using a kick (and ask<br>
nicely), and you can keep your kicks.  It's also a bad idea to kick a ready<br>
player, no matter how they're acting.  If they're talking trash or being a cock,<br>
but they're ready... just /mute them.  Don't boot a ready enemy unless that<br>
person is preventing others from staying and readying... for example if<br>
someone is a yellow chicken rank and playing bigfoot, 9/10 people who see that<br>
player will leave because they don't want to play with a beginner using a <br>
bot that's popular with noobs.  By kicking that one chicken you might get <br>
people to stay, so that's an exception to the rule.  You also want to kick <br>
anyone who is being abusive to people on the enemy's team and causing them<br>
to not ready (i.e. getting them into an argument or encouraging them to steal<br>
your key).  Even something as innocent as spamming people's names rapidly can<br>
be so irritating that you might need to kick the offender just to get people<br>
to stay and play.  The key thing to remember is to ask before you kick.  It<br>
won't always work, but every time it does work you save one of your five kicks.<br>
This is especially true if someone comes in on your team and you are waiting<br>
for a friend.  Most people waste a kick here without even asking the person to<br>
leave, but a lot of players will be cool and leave if you ask nicely.<br>
<p>
III. Dealing with dickheads.<br>
------------------------------<br>
<p>
If asking politely and being cool doesn't work, the other guy is probably a <br>
dickhead.  Dickheads live to make you waste kicks and lose key.  They're only<br>
looking for attention, so don't give them any.  There are some tactics you can<br>
use -<br>
1. Wait patiently and quietly.  Dickheads with short attention spans might leave.<br>
2. Kick quietly and hope no more join.<br>
3. When you've done too much of option 2, you can make an example and kick <br>
everyone who isn't ready, not just the dickhead, and keep kicking everyone on<br>
the enemy team until your key is dropped.  It's better to do that and drop your<br>
key to a friend than to slowly kick the dickheads 1 at a time, so that there's<br>
still a 50/50 chance it ends up with someone on the enemy team.<br>
4. The long wait - your last resort... this is when you've used up 4 kicks <br>
and one more kick will absolutely lose your key.  If an enemy is being an ass<br>
and trying to get you to use that last kick, then don't.  Sit and wait patiently.<br>
Ask your buddies to do the same.  Have everyone unready on your team and tell them<br>
to just go afk for 10 minutes.  If someone is determined to ruin your game,<br>
you can at least force them to waste a ton of time doing it.  Also, at some <br>
point people on the enemy team will start to leave.  If it ever reaches a point<br>
where there are... let's say 2 people on the enemy team and 4 on your side... <br>
just kick one of the enemies quickly.  That way there's only 1 enemy left, which <br>
means there's only a 1 in 4 chance that the key will end up on the wrong team.<br>
Sometimes, very rarely, threats to report the other person will have an effect.<br>
Tell them you're filling out the form while you wait and screencapped their <br>
text.  Hell, you can even actually try reporting them if you want... I don't<br>
know if softnyx does anything about it.  It's worth a try.  Lastly, it doesn't <br>
hurt to pretend to leave, and to be as convincing as you can be about it.  For<br>
example talk to a friend and ask if they want to go to lunch, and pretend you're<br>
going to meet in real life.  You can actually go afk safely if your friend is <br>
helping, and find something besides gunbound to keep you occupied.<br>
<p>
IV. Passing the key.<br>
-----------------------<br>
<p>
Sometimes you want to get the key to your friend(s) before leaving the room, <br>
or you just don't want to host because you have a laggy connection etc.<br>
There is no easy trick to give the key to a specific person, don't trust<br>
anyone who says you can use some /key command or whatever.  It's all lies.<br>
There is a smart way to pass the key and a stupid way.  The stupid way is to<br>
just leave and rejoin the room, with a better than 50% chance that the key will<br>
end up with an enemy.  You can also kick people slowly until it passes, which <br>
is pretty much the same thing (if you don't kick fast, and there are 8 ppl in<br>
the room when you make your final kick, you have pretty much done the same<br>
thing as leaving the room.. there's no control over who might get the key).<br>
<p>
The smart way to pass the key goes like this -<br>
-close the room<br>
-close the room some more if possible.<br>
-kick any remaining enemies until it's just teammates.<br>
-if you haven't run out of kicks by now, leave and your key will pass to a <br>
-random friend.  Or you can ask some friends to leave first and pass to<br>
-a specific friend.<br>
<p>
Detail on how to do this perfectly without fuckups:<br>
<p>
1. If there's any chance that 2 slots on the enemy team might clear out<br>
(from people getting bored and leaving) then wait for your chance and<br>
immediately click the 4:4 (game settings) button.  If you manage to click<br>
the 4:4 button when there are only 6 people in the room, it will successfully<br>
change to 3:3 even if 4 people are on your team's side.<br>
<p>
2. If you can't wait for people to give you a natural 3:3 opportunity or<br>
whatever, then you can create one... but you must use a trick to it.<br>
If you just kick two people quickly and try to change to 3:3, you might<br>
be too slow and someone will join just as you're trying to close the room<br>
up.  The trick is this: type /kick UserName  ...where UserMame is some enemy<br>
who isn't leaving soon.  Don't actually press enter and kick them.  Instead,<br>
hold shift and press home after you type it.  This selects the text with a <br>
yellow box.  Press ctrl+X on your keyboard to copy the text.  Now type out<br>
another /kick command, this time /kick Username2 (where Username2 is a <br>
different enemy who also seems likely to stay).  Now move your mouse<br>
so that it's hovering over the 4:4 button.  Do the next 3 steps as fast <br>
as you can to close the room...<br>
- press enter (kicks username2)<br>
- press ctrl+V, then enter (pastes the command you copied earlier and<br>
  kicks the first user)<br>
- click with the mouse.<br>
If you did these fast enough, two enemies will be kicked one after the other very<br>
quickly, and you can close down the room to 3:3 with a single quick click before<br>
anyone else can join your room.<br>
<p>
3. Repeat step 2 if you want, it's possible to close down to 2:2 and leave just<br>
yourself and your teammates.<br>
<p>
4. If your key isn't passed yet, but you can see that there are only friends <br>
left in your room, exit quickly before any enemies can join.  The key is passed.<br>
<p>
V. Raiding and dealing with raids.<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
<p>
Room raiding is a trick used to capture the key to a room, it's also called<br>
stealing a room.  The idea is simple... get as many friends as you can to <br>
join a room and refuse to ready up.  The key is forced to kick them if he<br>
has any hopes of starting a game, and after kicking 5 of them he will lose<br>
the key and with any luck one of the raiders hopes to catch the key.<br>
You might think "but they can't rejoin if I kick, and what if there are <br>
only 2 or 3 people trying... they can't do it, right?"  ... nope, they <br>
can.  When you're kicked, you can just exit gunbound and restart it to<br>
join a room you're 'banned' from.  If you're fast, you can sometimes<br>
tell you were kicked but the game seems to think you're still in the<br>
room due to lag.  If you voluntarily exit before it 'sees' the kick, you <br>
can rejoin it immediately, which some dumb people think is a hack.<br>
<p>
To deal with a room raid, you have a few options.<br>
<p>
1. Talk them out of it.. "don't be lame come on.  Find another room to <br>
raid.  We're not stupid, you're not gonna get the key, find dumber people<br>
to pick on.  You shouldn't do this to other wands.  I'm gonna report you."<br>
blah blah blah.  This will never work vs determined room raiders.<br>
<p>
2. Outwait them.  This is a painful and boring option, but you can simply<br>
refuse to kick and see who gets bored first.  You might try passing the time<br>
by talking with one of your friends in the room about something that interests<br>
you both.  Or you can pass the time by going afk, and maybe ask a friend to <br>
keep an eye on the room while you're gone (they can MSN you when the raiders<br>
have left).  A lot of room raiders are capable of waiting patiently.  This<br>
option sucks but is effective, sometimes it's the only thing you can do.<br>
<p>
3. Use smart kicking and try to close the room - apply step 2 from the <br>
previous section.  When the room is closed down to a point where no enemies<br>
can get in, they might not bother to keep trying.  If you have to, you can<br>
play vs your friends for one or more games.  Often seeing a game start <br>
causes raiders to give up.<br>
<p>
4. Call friends to help fill up the slots on the enemy team... that <br>
gives the raiders fewer slots to try to steal and gives you a better chance<br>
of starting when some random noob joins and readies.<br>
<p>

ok that's it, I hope people can control their frigging rooms now :D<br>
