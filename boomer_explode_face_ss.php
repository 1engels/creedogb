<body>This is the raw data from some practice sessions I had with<br>
Untzremark to try to figure out how to make a boomer<br>
"explode in your face" timebomb SS formula.<br>
<br>
All I can say for sure after lots of practice is that I have a 1 SD<br>
and half screen distance shot.<br>
<br>
1 screen timebomb ss: 18, 2.5 bars<br>
1/2 s.d. timebomb ss: 40, 1.4 bars<br>
<br>
For a bit over 1 screen, keeping the angle and just adding a<br>
bit of power is fine. The angle is the important thing, the power<br>
can vary a bit as long as you don't shoot with too little power<br>
and it hits dirt. It's basically a shotgun with a little angle<br>
and not so much power that it goes across the screen instantly.<br>
<br>
I still don't have a formula, but I'll share the<br>
info that I have, maybe someone can make sense of it.<br>
<br>
How to read the info: <br>
First number is angle.<br>
Second is power.<br>
Third is wind strength.<br>
Fourth is wind direction, which I express with u(up),f(forward),<br>
d(down) and b(back). The more you see of a direction, the more<br>
the wind was pointing that way. So uuuub means almost straight up<br>
and only a little back. db means exactly 45 degrees down and against<br>
wind.<br>
----------<br>
30 1.9 9 uuf <br>
25 2.2 24 f<br>
14 2.45 15 uuuuub<br>
23 3 8 db<br>
2.3 17 uff<br>
16 3.1 20 b<br>
18 2.4 8 uuf<br>
27 2.65 15 dddf<br>
24 2.8 15 dddb<br>
20 2.5 9 uub<br>
14 2.8? 25 ub<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
wind towards:<br>
lowest angle: 17<br>
highest angle: 30<br>
lowest power: 1.9<br>
highest: 2.65<br>
<br>
wind against: <br>
lowest angle: 14<br>
highest angle: 24<br>
lowest power: 2.45<br>
highest power: 3.1<br><br>
