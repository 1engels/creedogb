<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
Here are some questions I get asked a lot, in some way or another.<br>
Some are about Turtle, and some are more general.
<ul>
<li>Is it really necessary to deal with all these numbers? I don't want to
shoot with formulas, I'm a feel player. Can't I play Turtle with feel?
<p>
Yes, you can play with feel if you want, but feel often won't get you the correct 
angle for SSes or forks, which require very precise angle and power.
For shot 2's, feel works up to a point, but you have to remember that 
you need lots of airtime for this shot. Feeling a low angle shot is easy 
and natural, but feeling high angle, high power shots is not so easy. 
For example if you can feel shots pretty well with 
angle 60, your shot 2 will have enough airtime for 3/4 and 1 screen 
shots, but not enough airtime for 1/2 screen. Even with angle 70, the
airtime is barely enough for a half screen shot, and you'll be forced to 
use angles in the 80's for closer shots. Also, I believe that you cannot 
feel shots past 1 screen... you need experience to make those 
shots, or else a good formula. My style of play is to calculate as much 
as I can, unless there's no time or it's important to shoot fast. Remember
though that formulas don't guarantee hits or make you an aimbot. A LOT 
of the shots I mention (including timebombs) suggest that you learn to 
feel your shots. Don't use formulas in a dumb way without understanding 
how the shot works, how the formula is compensating for wind, etc.

<li>What about BJSL or some of the other formulas?
<p>
BJSL is a great formula for most bots, but Turtle is suited to a fixed power 
shot because you cannot use low power for close shots (which is part of how 
BJSL works). People will already say there are too many formulas in this 
guide so I won't cover BJSL or other shooting methods.

<li>How do I hit middle range shots if I can't get a high angle?
<p>
The safest way, if you can get the angle, is to use the "ss angle+3" trick.
Figure out the angle for an SS, then add 3 angles and use a bit more power.
This gives the shot the 2.5 second airtime needed to converge, barely. For
a half screen shot you'd need an angle like 69 to pull this off. If you 
can't even get a nice angle like 69, then you should memorize the fork shots 
listed earlier. They're great when you're forced to shoot with a low angle.

<li>I don't understand the windchart.
<p>
When I first started using the windchart, I used a very simple method:<br>
Wind against or down: lower angle by (wind/2) then shoot.<br>
Wind up or towards: raise angle by (wind/2) then shoot.<br>
Basic example: 10 wind against you, do 10/2 to get 5. Lower 
your angle by 5. So a half screen shot goes from 75, 2.4 to 70 2.4...<br>
Wind 14 towards enemy: Raise angle by 14/2, so
raise 7 angles, then shoot with the usual power.
Later I figured out that wind/2 is not good enough for all situations, and I 
would remember special exceptions like "medium wind, add or lower 1 more
angle, strong wind add or lower 2 more angles"... so for example, in 14 wind towards 
the enemy, raising 7 angles would make the shot fly too far because this is "medium" 
wind, so I should have raised 1 more angle (8 angles). Then I figured out 
that for other wind directions, I should divide by other numbers, like down+forward wind 
needs wind/4. Finally, I came to understand windcharts using decimals instead of 
fractions. "Wind/2" is the same thing as saying ".5 of wind". So a wind factor of .5 meant
wind/2, a factor of .25 meant wind/4, etc. Most windcharts use factors like .5, .3, .25, etc.
The way I am able to use these charts is to convert these fractions into some shortcut,
like converting .35 into "Wind/3". That way I could see that 21 wind x .35 is roughly 7.
Doing this is easier for me than doing decimal multiplication.<br>
If you're still confused, it may help to read <a href="../using_formula.php">
this info</a>. If you still don't understand, I probably can't help you because I 
have explained this the best I can, in the easiest words I can.

<li>I don't understand _____ . Can you train me 1v1?
<p>
No, sorry. I find that most people who don't get these formulas are usually 
just too lazy to learn and memorize them. I explain everything in this guide. If you 
still can't figure it out, try reading some old GBGL posts and some guides written by 
other players. Maybe it will be easier to learn when it comes from someone else. 
But don't ask me to give you personal training. I want to spend my time on gunbound 
playing real games with friends. I already have spent so much time trying to help 
people with Turtle that it isn't fair to ask me to use my gunbound time too. Anyway,
on the few occasions that I have tried to train someone 1v1, they have a short attention 
span, they get bored, they're not really interested in learning, or they just wanted to 
1v1 me to see my skills or show me their own skills. Even if someone is 
really trying to learn, it sucks for me to type angles, powers, and windcharts over 
and over when I have already written this info down many times on my site.

<li>How do you calculate all these things without using a calculator?
<p>
For almost any calculation there is a shortcut, like dividing wind/2 when you are 
calculating a .5 wind factor, or remembering that .7 means raising 7 angles for every 
10 wind. It's important to memorize your 0 wind info completely so that it takes no time 
at all to know the 0 wind angle and power for your shot.

<li>How do I divide a screen into "parts"? How can you measure exactly?
<p>
The first step is to memorize the little landmarks on your screen to help you 
remember certain shots. I tend to think more in terms of angles than parts. Like,
if I'm using the 2.4 formula and the enemy is 1/3rd of the screen away, I don't see 
them at "part 10", I see them at "angle 80". Then I can start calculating the wind 
adjustment right away. Also, some may feel this is cheating, but you can make 
a paper ruler and tape it under your monitor, or make a transparency and 
put it on the screen. But you should memorize the other ways of measuring too,
so if you ever visit a friend and play with them in a lan shop, or if you ever go
to a tournament, you don't look like a noob who can't measure properly.

<li>Are you the best Turtle in gunbound?
<p>
No. People think I am good player because I run a website. This doesn't make sense.
Running a website has nothing to do with being skilled in gunbound. Having 1,000 formulas 
also doesn't make you the best player, if you can't use them properly or if they have bad info.
Also, I didn't write all the formulas on my site. I wrote less than 5% of them. I only share what 
other people send me or what I find on my own. I might be the most famous Turtle but I am not the best.
As for the best Turtle, if you're curious what I think, the answer is Mishigne. 
He has perfect formulas, perfect windcharts, and calculates 
everything very carefully. I calculate in a sloppy, imprecise way. For Mishi, a real windchart
has 32 factors, not just 9 or 17, and it has 3 different factors for small, medium, and strong winds,
not just 1 average factor. He's the kind of player who hits almost all of his forks and Timebomb SSes 
on his first try. He misses sometimes, but not much (and yes, it's already been proven through 
a webcam that he's not aimbotting).
Other awesome turtles who are probably better than me include Chill (formerly ricebaiikhao) and 
Tao.

<li>How do you make a formula? Where did you get this info?
<p>
Some info I got from friends, some I got from 1v1 testing and experience, and some I calculated 
using publicly available programs. Forks and timebombs can be calculated with Yoyobuae's 
<a href=http://www.gbgl-hq.com/forums/index.php?topic=7359.0>Aimchart</a> which gives you 
the angles and powers for any fixed timing shot. You can use it to get accurate wind factors 
for almost any shot, once you know the airtime of that shot.
<ul>
<li>Generate a chart with the correct airtime (like ~1.9 seconds for forks)
<li>Open the chart in photoshop and rotate it so it's flat
<li>Copy and paste the wind scale onto a new layer
<li>Rotate the windscale to the correct angle to figure out wind adjustment for a 
certain wind factor. Like rotate it 45 degrees and set the "0" wind point at the
1/2 screen position on the chart to get info about 45 degree up+back wind at 
the half screen mark (the wind scale 'points' in the direction opposite 
the wind that you're charting).
<li>Look up different angles and powers for this wind, like maybe look up the angles 
and powers for 5 wind, 10 wind, 15 wind, etc. For my half screen Turtle ss chart I 
looked up the info for every 3 wind.
<li>Write down how the angle and and power changed from your 0 wind shot.
<li>Divide the angle adjustment by the wind's strength to get a wind factor.<br>
Divide the power adjustment by the wind's strength to get a power factor.
<li>Average several factors together to get one "overall" factor, or try
averaging several weak factors to get a number for weak wind adjusting,
then several medium factors to get medium adjusting, etc.
<li>Write this info on your chart then repeat for at least 8 other wind directions.
Most formulas are easier and don't require this kind of effort to calculate. 
Timebombs and forks are special because they are fixed timing shots. You must 
not only try to get the distance correct, you must get the airtime correct.
Most shots don't care at all about airtime, and you only need to figure out how 
to get the distance correct. 
</ul>

<li>Why use Turtle, isn't armor/trico/etc. better?
<p>
I just like Turtle. It's more fun than armor, easier than trico, and there's 
absolutely nothing more fun for me than playing with timing shots like 
the timebomb SS and forks. I won't say it's the best bot in the game, 
but it's not bad and I really enjoy playing it. I'm not interested in being 
the best in gunbound anyway.

<li>Can I add you?
<p>
No. I don't add random strangers. I don't care what your rank is (rank 
doesn't have anything to do with skill). I don't care what you think your 
skill level is. I don't care if you're a friend of another friend. I don't care 
if you're "pro". I definitely don't care if you want to 1v1 me or if you 
want personal training. I'm not going to add you just because you want
to ask a question. Go ahead and ask. I'm not going to add you just 
because you want to find out what room I'm in so you can see me play. 
Ask what room I'm in and maybe you can come play on the other team.
I don't have anything to prove to anybody and I don't care what you 
think of me. The answer is always no. I have tons of buddies and get 
new requests every day. I don't care 
if you think I am arrogant for not wanting to buddy you.
That's fine, why would you want an arrogant buddy?
PS: Trying to add me more than once won't change my mind, but it will
annoy me and get you muted and guarantee I will never ever ever 
be your buddy even if you're the best player in the world.

<li>What's happening with Lord™?
<p>
I don't know and don't care. Lord stopped being a pro, active guild a long 
time ago (maybe before I even joined) and I don't see other Lord players much.
Cbchui is no longer GM, don't ask me who is because I don't know.

<li>When will you update the site?
<p>
When I feel like it.

<li>What's your real name? Where do you live? What do you do?
<p>
I don't share personal info on the internet, even if you're just 
making conversation and trying to be nice.

<li>Do you use drag or slice?
<p>
Mostly slice. But I have learned drag and for fun I will try 
playing with it, especially using Trico. But with slice I 
never miss my power (1/100 times maybe) while with drag
I will miss it 1/10 times. I know it's possible to get better with 
drag and hit your power almost every time, but I don't have the 
patience to learn. I will of course drag for full power shots.

<li>What is your rank? What is your win rate?
<p>
I'm a ruby wand. I have lost and regained the wand 3 times 
now, so I am a very low level ruby. I will never be diamond because 
I just don't play enough hours per day. My winrate is 68-69%. 
I am satisfied with that. I could get it higher by refusing to play good players, 
or playing in avatar on, but I don't care about it. 
I am very suspicious of players whose winrates are over 80%. 
Try to remember that because of botting,
rank and winrate are meaningless. Even players who didn't bot usually 
got their nice stats by playing 1v1 jewel in avatar on mode, beating up 
players with less skill and weaker equipment. I'd rather have 70% playing 
random score and solo games than 90% playing jewel.

<li>Will you 1v1 me and show me your turtle?
<p>
No, I hate 1v1, and like I said I'd rather be playing with friends 
than trying to entertain other people or prove something.

<li>What zone do you play in? 
<p>
Almost always 11. If you want to find me, sometimes my name is in the 
room title. You can message me and ask me what room I'm in, but if I'm 
in the middle of a game then I probably won't answer because I can't 
remember my room number once I'm playing. I also won't answer anyone 
with a stupid, hard to type nickname like xXpr0AdukalIlIl.

<li>Why do you write so much and make these long guides?
<p>
I just enjoy it. I also want to help other people get good. 
I type very fast, sometimes I forget how much I have typed 
and sometimes I'm too lazy to edit everything to be shorter. 
One nice benefit is that just by writing things down, I remember 
them better and become a better player. It works for the same 
reason that teachers make you do written homework. 
In some cases I am forced to look up or calculate 
things that I never tried to learn before.
