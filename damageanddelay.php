A quick note on damage, delay, etc: 
Damage is based on how clean your hit is, and whether or not your shot was 
partially blocked by dirt.  The damages I give are based on a solid center hit 
using true angle vs a mobile with average defense.  In some conditions your shot
will do more or less.  I'd say your best shot 1 will be 200 dmg and a miracle 
shot 2 will do 325.  One other important note on damage: your aiming slice has a
solid, bright green part and a faded, washed out pale green part.  The solid 
green in the middle of your aim slice is called 'true' angle, any shots where 
your pointer is in this solid green part will do full, normal damage.  The 
washed out green at the edges of your aim slice is called weak angle.  This does 
about 20% less damage.  You therefore should always try to use true angle, which
may require moving boomer to get your pointer high or low enough.  
<p>
Delay is fixed, and for every second you take to shoot, the delay for your shot 
will have 10 points added.  Certain items also add to your delay.  For example a
normal SS fired with no delay is 1280 'time units'.  If you used 3 seconds to 
fire the shot, you are now using 1280+30 time units, so that's 1310 time units. 
If you use a dual+ item with boomer's shot 1, you are adding 250 delay to your 
natural delay of 730.  Dual+ is therefore 980 delay as long as you use shot 1 
first.  That means dual+ delay is only 100 more than using a normal shot 2. 
There's a myth some players spread that doing shot 2 first gives better damage.
This is a lie.  Use 1 first.
