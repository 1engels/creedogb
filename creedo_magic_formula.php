<body><h1>The 2.8 method<br/>
<br/>
and Magic Formula.</h1><br>
<br>
I originally learned from a friend (I think Tinyk0ol) a simple<br>
formula for making a full power shot travel exactly half as far.<br>
The trick was to use the same angle and 2.75 bars. Later,<br>
through the help of gbgl forum people (almost all the credit<br>
goes to Eatemalive and 00Sniper) I was able determine<br>
the true power should be 2.8 bars, and I was able to figure<br>
out some other great tricks for mathematically figuring out<br>
how to increase/decrease the distance of any shot.<br>
<br>
These formulas apply to any bot, any shot (using just about<br>
any angle and in any wind). Try it on your favorite mobile.<br>
It even applies to boomer and boomer's weird hooks and whatnot,<br>
though of course you can't use an angle that would backshot.<br>
<br>
<h2>MAGIC FORMULA 1:</h2>
To make a full power shot travel exactly half as far as before, use 2.8 bars power<br>
(with the same angle and wind conditions as your full shot).<br>
Examples: <br>
<br>
81 4.0 bars = 1 screen  ...therefore<br>
81 2.8 bars = 1/2 screen distance.<br>
<br>
Angle 58, 4.0 bars = 1 SD hook with boomer in most 3 wind down+against.<br>
Angle 58, 2.8 bars = 1/2 SD 'minihook' in the same wind.<br>
<br>
<h2>MAGIC FORMULA 2:</h2>
To make any shot travel exactly half a far as before, you only need to<br>
use 70% of your original power. It's 70.7% to be precise. This isn't<br>
as hard to calculate as you might think. Here's how I do it:<br>
Figure out 2/3rds of your original power. Then add .05 bars if the<br>
result is less than 2 bars. Add .1 bars of power if the result is greater<br>
than 2 bars. That's it. If your original power is full power you'll be<br>
adding a bit over .1 bars, you want to use 2.8 bars when calculating<br>
70% of full power.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
A known 1 screen shot for armor is 60, 2.5 bars.<br>
Step 1: <br>
2/3rds of 2.5 bars is a bit over 1.6 bars. Let's call it 1.65.<br>
Step 2:<br>
Add a bit of power, .05 in this case (we're dealing with less than <br>
2 bars of power). That brings your power up to 1.7.<br>
<br>
So 60, 1.7 should be a half screen shot for armor. If you know armor<br>
and have seen some of the guides and info out there, you know this<br>
is accurate.<br>
<br>
Using my own angle 45 info for boomer, 2.15 bars = 1 screen.<br>
Step 1:<br>
2/3rds of 2.15 bars is about 1.4 bars. <br>
Step 2:<br>
Add a bit and you get 1.45 bars. You can see from the 45 guide<br>
that angle 45, 1.45 really is the power UntzRemark and I found for<br>
a half screen shot.<br>
<br>
<h2>MAGIC FORMULA 3:</h2>
To make any shot travel twice as far as the original, just<br>
increase your power by 41% (multiply by 1.414 to be exact). <br>
41% takes some practice to calc. Just remember that 40% of<br>
each bar is .4 .... so 40% of a 1 bar shot is .4 bars, and 40% of<br>
a 2 bar shot is .8 ... etc.<br>
<br>
You won't ever need to calculate 40%<br>
of 3 and 4 bars because your final answer would be more than<br>
full power. So you simply calculate .4 or .8 and add that to your<br>
original power. If your original power isn't exactly 1 or 2 bars, you<br>
must calculate 40% of the 'leftover' and add that on too. So let's<br>
say you're using 2.4 bars of power originally. That's 2 full bars<br>
and then .4 "leftover" bars. You know you will add .8 for those<br>
2 full bars. You now just need to figure out 40% of .4 (call it .15 or .2)<br>
So your total is:<br>
2.4 (original power)<br>
+.8 (for the 2 full bars)<br>
+.2 (for the 'leftover' bar)<br>
------------<br>
3.4 is the final answer. So a 3.4 bar shot will travel twice as far<br>
as a 2.4 bar shot. Useful if you're armor or turtle.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
A half screen lob using boomer's 2 bar formula is angle 72.<br>
So if 72, 2.0 is half a screen, what do you need to go 1 full screen?<br>
2.0 (original power)<br>
+.8 (for the 2 full bars)<br>
+0 (no leftover since it was exactly 2.0 bars)<br>
---------------------<br>
2.8 will be a 1 screen shot with boomer at angle 72.<br>
<br>
A 1/3 screen shot with turtle using cbchui-style fixed power is<br>
angle 80, 2.4 bars of power.<br>
2.4 (original power)<br>
+.8 (for the 2 full bars)<br>
+.2 (approx. 41% of the .4 bars leftover)<br>
------------------------------<br>
3.4 bars with angle 80 should travel 2/3 screen distance.<br>
<br>
Using phantomd's angle 35 fixed formulas, we know a 1<br>
screen shot with armor is 35, 2.48 bars.<br>
2.48 (original power)<br>
+.8 (for the 2 full bars)<br>
+.2 (approx 41% of the .48 bars leftover)<br>
---------------------------------<br>
3.48 (call it 3.5) should hit 2 screen distances with angle 35.<br>
So now you know a 2 screen shot even if you only<br>
have read info up to 1.5 screens before with armor.<br>

<h2>MAGIC FORMULA 3:</h2>
If you double the power of your last shot, you make it travel <b>4 times</b><br>
as far. The most useful application of this is to make a 1/2 screen shot<br>
travel exactly 2 screens. Be careful though, your starting power must be<br>
2.0 or below, and at this lower power level your angle doesn't<br>
matter so much, but at 4.0 power 1 angle makes a huge<br>
difference. So don't be shocked if 66, 4.0 bars doesn't<br>
go 2 screens with turtle even though it's ok to do 66, 2.0<br>
to hit half screen.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
Boomer can hit half screen with 72, 2.0<br>
So 72, 4.0 should hit 2 screens. If you know<br>
boomer high angles, you already know it's 9<br>
angles to 1 screen, and therefore 18 angles<br>
to 2 screens. So 72 full should be correct for<br>
2 screen distances.<br>
<br>
At angle 35, a 1/4 screen shot with armor is 1.25.<br>
Therefore a 1 screen shot should be 2.5, and you'll<br>
see from phantomd's guide this is true (he uses 1.24 and<br>
2.48 but close enough).<br>

<h2>MAGIC FORMULA 4:</h2>
A shot at any power level using angle 45<br>
will travel twice as far as a shot at angle 75 using the same power.<br>
Conversely, to make a shot travel half as far as as usual when your starting<br>
angle is 45, raise your angle to 75 and use the same power.<br>

Example: <br>
<br>
45 2.18 bars = 1 screen  ...therefore<br>
75 2.18 bars = 1/2 screen.<br>

<h2>MAGIC FORMULA 5:</h2>
A shot fired at X angles below angle 45<br>
will travel the same distance as a shot fired at X angles above 45.<br>
That means a shot fired 10 angles below 45 (at angle 35) will go<br>
the same distance as a shot fired 10 angles above 45 (at angle 55)<br>
if you use the same power. This is true more at 0 wind than with<br>
wind, but even with wind it's more or less accurate.<br>
<br>
That means if you know angle 60 for any mobile, you also know how<br>
to shoot at angle 30 because 60 is 15 angles over 45, and 30 is 15 angles under.<br>
That also means any angle 50 formula will use the same power levels<br>
as an angle 40 formula<br>

Example: <br>
<br>
35,  3.05 bars = 1.5 screen shot with armor<br>
35 is ten angles below 45.
Ten angle above 45 would be 55.
Therefore, angle 55, 3.05 bars is also a 1.5 screen shot
with armor.<br>

<h2>FINAL MAGIC FORMULA</h2>
Power Needed =<br>
(Power Used On Original Shot)<br>
* Square root of (Required Distance/Distance Original shot Went)<br>
-----------------------------<br>
I'll explain how I came to this. Or actually, I didn't come to it,<br>
Eatemalive did, and I'm just sharing it. <br>
The math needed to make the first 3 magic formulas:<br>
To double your distance, multiply your power by the square root of 2.<br>
To triple your distance, multiply your power by the square root of 3.<br>
Quadruple your distance, multiply your power by the square root of 4.<br>
You see the pattern? It works with fractions too... to make a shot<br>
travel half as far, multiply your power by the square root of 1/2. <br>
The big formula at the top is based on this<br>
simple rule that never changes.<br>
<br>
USES FOR THIS STUFF:<br>
1. Sometimes you don't want to use a high angle or can't<br>
get a high angle because there's no slope. So you can<br>
calculate the angle needed to make a certain shot<br>
travel twice as far as your enemy's distance... then<br>
use the 70% rule to come up with the correct new power.<br>
<br>
For example, with boomer,<br>
if the enemy is half a screen away and the wind is 15 against you,<br>
trying a half screen full power hook might screw up and fly back.<br>
If you just calculate a 1 screen shot (which would use a safe angle<br>
around 50 and would not fly back) you can apply the 70% formula to<br>
hit half a screen away with a low angle.<br>
<br>
You could also figure out a low power alternative to your<br>
typical shots so that you can have less airtime and make a neat SS.<br>
For example, with armor you can figure out the distance from your<br>
enemy in cbchui parts, multiply that distance by 2, and then<br>
use the resulting angle with 1.65 bars (or 1.7) instead of 2.4 bars<br>
to hit the enemy. This should make for a pretty nice looking timebomb<br>
SS.<br>
<br>
Let's say you're stuck on flat ground with turtle. You know how to<br>
hit 2 screens with full power shots, but what if you can't get angles<br>
over 70? Well, if you know 60 is 2.5 bars for 1 screen, adding 70%<br>
will bring you up to 3.5 bars. Without this formula, how else will<br>
you know 3.5 bar shots? There are 3 bar and 4 bar formulas but<br>
nothing for 3.5...<br>
<br>
2. You can create your own formula. You can be the only guy<br>
in the world to use angle 47 fixed with boomer or 64 with armor.<br>
You can create a 1.7 bar SS formula for armor, etc. You<br>
can also take any existing formula and take it further. I never<br>
tested 1.5 and 2 screen shots with boomer when I was<br>
coming up with a 45 fixed formula with UntzRemark... but with<br>
the formula I know 2.6ish will be 1.5 screens and 3.05<br>
will be 2 screen distances.<br>
<br>
3. You can double check existing formulas, and see why<br>
some formulas fail and confirm which formula is correct<br>
when 2 people are giving different info. For example with<br>
angle 70 bjsl, honghong gives 2.4 bars and angelgalz<br>
gives 2.3 for a 3/4 screen shot. They both seem to agree<br>
that 1 SD is 2.7 ... so using the formula, find the<br>
square root of 3/4 and multiply it by 2.7 to find the<br>
power for 3/4 screen. The result is 2.338, looks like<br>
angelgalz' info should be used.<br>
<br>
I hope this was useful and fun for some people.<br>
It's a lot of math and I wouldn't worry about using<br>
these formulas until you already know lots of<br>
other good formulas and are just bored of them :D<br>
