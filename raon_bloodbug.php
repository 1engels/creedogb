1. Basic Shooting Info<br>
1a. Shot 1 = 750 delay/150 average damage (180 on bionics)<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Your bread and butter shot, you must use it when shot 2 isn't an option. It eats land <br>
like crazy, in a straight, narrow hole. Landed right, you can incapacitate low-angle <br>
mobiles(bigfoot, lightning) in a pinch. It don't destroy much land with a direct hit, <br>
so if you are a bunge-happy weirdo, you should practice to aim a little before the mobile. <br>
This is no easy bunge such as cake.<br>
<p>
1b. Shot 2 = 900 delay/275 average damage (300 on bionics)<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This shot is what the Raonlauncher is all about. It shoot two mines who don't follow each <br>
other, since one is launched with more velocity than the other to prevent cheese damage<br>
(imagine landing two mines perfectly 1 and 1/2 screens away? Broken!). This is the weapon <br>
to shotgun, bypassing even Boomer's brute power (650+ per dual isn't uncommon). However, <br>
learning to shotgun them is harsh, but it's well worth it. Without this weapon, Raon is <br>
only a weak-butt bunge machine. Abuse it well. However, the mines are less attracted by <br>
bionics. Bummer.<br>
Note:Avoid dualing mines with thor unless you know what the hell you're doing. How many <br>
times have I seen duals go to waste like that? The second wave's thor beams will destroy <br>
the first wave if not targeted insanely perfect, so unless you want to get laughed at, <br>
don't dual with thor!<br>
<p>
1c. Shot SS = 1370 delay/300 average damage (325 on bionics)<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
A walking robot that walks when it lands for around 3 seconds (MasterOfMe suggests more, <br>
like 5 or 6 seconds). Almost a guaranteed hit, but watch out, it doesn't climb well. <br>
What's interesting is that this shot flies further than shot 1 or the center of the <br>
spread of shot 2 by a tad. No further explanation really needed. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
2. How to use shot 1 to not look like a dummy<br>
Yes, it finally happened! The updated version of my guide is there! Along with the update <br>
various notes, and a whole new section! So let's begin, eh?<br>
<p>
Raon is known to eat land like an hot knife through butter. But many raon noobs doesn't <br>
know very well how to use shot 1, which is "pretty-damaging". The primary use of shot 1 <br>
for my style of play, is giving me some good shotgun angles. Nono, you don't wait for <br>
them to pass by, you build them. The technique varies with the amount of land to eat, <br>
but I like to shotgun the land just before the enemy, so that unlucky guy finish a little <br>
curved, perfect for a shotgun.<br>
<p>
The other use. a little more defensive is to at the bad guy's angle. Yeah, you can do <br>
that...what? Anyway, to eat it, you gotta shoot your damned shot 1 at the feet of the <br>
enemy, so the land open below him and make him fall. Oh, and I also got a super new <br>
strategy called the super pit of doom. I will explain it a little later.<br>
<p>
And now, the primary use of shot 1 : bunging. Although I use shot 2 to fancy-bunge <br>
when I can, shot 1 is better for bunging than 2. You gotta use it for removing the land, <br>
but not by shooting mushrooms on the head of the guy. Use the technique described earlier, <br>
or better yet, shotgun.<br>
<p>
FOR MY SUPER STRATEGY OF DOOM 2 raons<br>
Miramo map, or any map with a whole lot of land.<br>
Luck<br>
Teles disabled<br>
<p>
STEP 1 :<br>
Get your ally to tunnel under the guy you wanna doom.<br>
<p>
STEP 2 :<br>
Incapacitate him with an angle-eating shot 1.<br>
<p>
STEP 3 :<br>
Make your partner make a pit under the guy and fill it with raon babies(8)<br>
<p>
STEP 4 :<br>
Defend your ass.<br>
<p>
STEP 5 :<br>
The teammate should drop the enemy in the raon pit of doom by the under.<br>
<p>
STEP 6 :<br>
Enjoy!<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
3. Advanced Shooting Techniques (aka: OMFG WTF HAX)<br>
2a. Raon Shotgun<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
So you are there, facing an enemy, a good slope and no thor? Alright, it's time to <br>
unleash the raon's fury! Climb on that slope, and get your needle to the center of your <br>
victim. The reason for this is that raon mines blow when they walk into the enemy's center, <br>
what I like to call "the sweetspot". So, if you shoot those mines directly at the <br>
sweetspot, they will blow immediately so there's no risk of enemy teleporting before your <br>
next turn. A really important thing to realize is that the babies have to hit ground <br>
to blow. This is wise to think about because if they go flying off the screen to the <br>
limits, they won't land (my want to reconsider full power on some shots). Also, you can <br>
do single shots with thor, but don't try to dual it. This seems easy, yet vaguely <br>
complicated, doesn't it? Not after you see the...<br>
<p>
3b. Raon Slip<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The raon slip is quite simple but hard to master. If the land is thin enough, the mines <br>
will bypass the land and get on the top of land. Let's get some ugly art to explain:<br>
<pre><br>
..................................<('.')>--enemy.................<br>
=================================================================<br>
.................................................................<br>
......................................A--needle..................<br>
......................................(i)--raon..................<br>
<p>
So if you are lucky enough to get that kind of thing...<br>
<p>
..................................^('.')^--omg hax -275 .........<br>
=====================================X===========================<br>
.................................................................<br>
......................................A..........................<br>
......................................(i)........................<br>
</pre><br>
The mines will bypass the land, get in your enemy's sweetspot, blow up, make them fall, <br>
and get you kicked of the game . Understood? If you need more in-depth explanation, <br>
msg me on Gunbound.<br>
<p>
3c. Raon Bounce<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is the advanced brother of the Raon slip. If the land isn't thin, the mines <br>
won't bypass the land. Instead, they will bounce off the roof you shot them on. <br>
More ugly art:<br>
<pre><br>
=================================================================<br>
=================================================================<br>
.................................................................<br>
.................................................................<br>
....................A......../|..................................<br>
................(i)........./ |.<('.')>--haha no sg for you......<br>
<p>
Pretty deep in the fecal matter, huh? But... <br>
=================================================================<br>
=================================================================<br>
...................................o.............................<br>
...........................o.....................................<br>
....................A......../|..................................<br>
................(i)........./ |.<('.')>--? lolol.................<br>
<p>
You shoot them at the roof... <br>
=================================================================<br>
===================================V=============================<br>
...................................o.............................<br>
...................................o.............................<br>
....................A......../|..................................<br>
................(i)........./ |.^('.')^--WTF?!?! -275............<br>
</pre><br>
And then they bounce of the roof, then boom! On the enemy sweetspot [edit: the mines <br>
immediately are on the enemy and the camera doesn't follow the mines, so they won't <br>
know what happened]. This one require serious practice. I think it's fairly clear. <br>
Again, don't hesitate to msg me.<br>
<p>
3d. Raon Sniper (High Angle Raons!)<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Okay, so you want to look like a pro huh? Follow these steps, and you will look like <br>
one. First, you must know the raon mines spread:<br>
<p>
90= omg lol masochist! No spread. <br>
84= omg lol pro! Half screen. <br>
79= omg lol even proer! 1 screen. <br>
45= omg lol noob! Max spread. <br>
0= omg lol you sger! No spread, nice sg angle. <br>
There. Now, the only way to hit both mines on contact is to do a low-power 89 angle. <br>
For that you must be very close. Why? 89 angle has. minimal spread, and with low power <br>
they don't separate much. Nice place to use a dual. With other angles, you should use <br>
them to surround your enemy, or use shot 1. Why? The enemy can move, tele, or worse, get <br>
them to hit you instead! This is easy to understand.<br>
<p>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
One last note in the advanced section from yours truly, Ybom. I wanted to point out that <br>
every Raoner should know that there is only one true Raon killer, and that is the tornado <br>
element! I tend to get them directly inbetween me, or directly on the opponent I'm going <br>
after, which severely limits your shot 2 and SS ability. The reason wht they are so bad, <br>
if you haven't experienced raon play with them yet, is that if the mines are in the <br>
center of one at all, they get sucked up into oblivion, whether they crawl into it or <br>
not. Plan around them any way you can (aka set mines to where they crawl after it <br>
changes to a new element, or push an enemy into them with bunge threats or something). <br>
Another key feature of tornadoes is that on the first turn of a new element after a <br>
nado, if it is your turn, and you have mines crawling that way, if the mines walk into <br>
where the nado will disappear, they will get sucked up. The reason for this is mines <br>
always crawl directly inbetween turns, right after the bombs drop in solo/tag and right <br>
after people get reincarnated in score. Just watch out for them finicky twisters, <br>
they hurt 10x more than they help; especially for Raoners. <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
4. Raon Vs Everything Else<br>
Aduka<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hmm, this one is a little tough. The recently buffed thor mobile is an electric type, <br>
dealing a little more damage on you with his shot 1. Shot 2 has horrid delay early-game, <br>
however, so abuse the weakness well. Shotgun when you can, and you will win.<br>
<p>
Armormobile<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This one is a tough one. Not only it got the firepower to beat you into submission, <br>
he has the land-eating capabilities to screw your angles well, removing the shotguns. <br>
Try to make him use false angle by putting him into an hole with shot 1 to attenuate <br>
the damage. Exploit the high-ass delay(hightest in the game) too.<br>
<p>
A.Sate<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The current broken machine, he got 230 damage for no skill needed(except at long-range) <br>
and a very strong delay-wise and power-wise non situational SS which hurts. He will <br>
give you angles by shooting you with 2, so abuse it.<br>
<p>
Bigfoot<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
An Armor copycat, this one can screw your angles even more, but it is way easier to <br>
screw his. Treat as a toned-down Armor.<br>
<p>
Boomer<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Weird bot this one is. He has extreme wind dependance on his shots, so a drastic wind <br>
change can screw him more than you. He CANNOT eat up your angle, since his land-eating <br>
is non-existent. The shotgun is extremely effective against him, and his low defence <br>
and health doesn't help him. Survive longer than him, and you won. Oh, don't try <br>
screwing his angle. You can't, unless it's for making him do 300 dmg a dual.<br>
<p>
Grub<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Easy as pie. He's big, slow, tickle like a girl, and to add at that, he's a bionic. <br>
Shotgun him to death and you won. Don't let him put you in an hole, that's the only <br>
thing you got to fear.<br>
<p>
Ice<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The hightest health in the game means he can survive quite a few turns. 3rd best angle <br>
in the game means you can't screw his angle, and true angle is dominent. Shot 1 can <br>
screw your angles, and shot 2 lowers your defence by 5%. Shotgun to death, like always.<br>
<p>
Jee-Day (JD; Cakebot)<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This one is made to cause you trouble. He got the advantage being an electric type, <br>
and to add insult to injury, he is the best angle-screwer is the game, plus a <br>
ridiculously low delay. Not to mention his sucking abilities can bunge you like crazy. <br>
Shotgun when you can, and try to shotgun him alot.<br>
<p>
Lightning<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Low angle range makes him susceptible to angle-eating. Beware of pro lightnings, <br>
cause at 230 damage for a shot 1 at 750 delay, you better screw his angle alot. <br>
Shotgun sparingly, this is one of the few mobiles it's better to use shot 1.<br>
<p>
Mage<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is a joke for you. He got decent firepower, decent movement, etc. But he got <br>
nothing good, and you don't even have a shield. Beat this up the way you like, he <br>
can't do much.<br>
<p>
Nak<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Imho, this is the easiest tank to beat for raon. You got defence vs hit types, <br>
meaning that extreme firepower isn't worth crap anymore. He can screw your angles, <br>
but more often than not, he will make them. High delay doesn't help him. Notably <br>
larger sweetspots than the other bots.<br>
<p>
Raon (Social War! Wee!)<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
You decided to fight yourself? Our bot screw angles with shot 1, blast with shot 2 <br>
and don't miss with SS. Make sure to don't get in an angle if you won't use it, <br>
since a good Raon like you now, Ihope, you gain advantage and will shotgun you. <br>
Take care, and use the advanced things he isn't aware of.<br>
<p>
Trico<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Poor dino isn't much of a threat, unless you are fighting a pro trico (ala mauvecow <br>
or dovo) who can blast you with 3 cabbages long range. If not, the only treat is <br>
angle-screwing.<br>
<p>
Turtle<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
He got a low angle and the worst movement in the game, meaning he can't escape nor <br>
1 neither 2. He can hurt you very well, however, so take care and don't give him a <br>
shotgun angle. No angle-screwingpotential.<br>
<p>
Knight/Dragon<br>
<p>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Bah, they are so strong you can't do nothing anyway. You can't eat up knight's <br>
angle and you can't baby shotgun dragon. Both hurt bad. Use 2 against knight and 1 <br>
agaisnt dragon. Dragon is very easy to bunge. Good luck.<br>

Thanks for reading this, and I hope you will become a good raon. I'd like to thank: <br>
Ybom = for teaching me how to play Raon. Thanks sensai! Nice playing with you! <br>
FloppyTongue = good GB bud with which I've had a lot of fun. <br>
Blarg13 = another good friend with which I've had cool games. <br>
LaHaine = nice all-around bud <br>
xipou = RL friend. <br>
saintcsa = wtf nice bud. <br>
Mom, god, etc = for letting me have time to write this. <br>
MasterOfMe = Signaling that the raon walk time is incorrect. Thanks! <br>
Zim and the others = Correction about dualing on Thor, but I still think it is quite <br>
dumb to dual on Thor. It CAN be done, but I don't think it's smart since it is <br>
uneffective most of the time [edit: unless shot as direct as possible downward on <br>
the opponent]. Oh well! <br>
UPDATE : Removing useless art/various corrections and for those who waited it, the <br>
ASCII art exaples are now up and well! Images will be coming soon, but for now <br>
you gotta stick with this! <br>
