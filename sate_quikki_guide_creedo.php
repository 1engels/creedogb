<br>
Shot 1 - <br>
<br>
Delay: 730<br>
Damage: ~150<br>
<br>
Low delay: You can beat any other player's shot 1 if you shoot<br>
after them and don't spend as much time aiming as they did.<br>
<br>
Angle fuxing: The shot makes a big round hole if it hits land.<br>
If the enemy is in a slope and you're close to them, plant<br>
shot 1 at their feet and it may ruin their angle.<br>
<br>
Bunge: If you need to bunge an enemy on a small bit of land, shot 1<br>
eats more dirt than shot 2 and is more likely to drop them down.<br>
<br>
Misses can hit: If a shot lands past them but they're in the line<br>
of fire between you and the tracer, they still can get hit.<br>
<br>
Shot 2 -<br>
<br>
Delay: 880<br>
Damage: ~250<br>
<br>
Low delay: As shot 2's go, this is fast. If you have a small delay<br>
advantage and someone uses shot 2, you can use your own shot 2 and<br>
then beat their delay... even vs. boomer's low delay.<br>
<br>
High damage: A clean hit can go up to 300 vs organic bots, who<br>
are weak to Sate (so Sate rapes boomer). An average hit is 240, as<br>
strong as many other popular bots like Armor and Boomer. Even a<br>
sloppy hit that misses a bit can be 150-200.<br>
<br>
Angle fuxing: Shooting from right to left, your shot 2 can make a<br>
vertical pit and put the enemy into it. They may be forced to shoot<br>
through dirt afterwards.<br>
<br>
SS -<br>
<br>
Delay: 1280<br>
Damage: ~450<br>
<br>
Low delay: Good delay for an SS, if the enemy tries any SS you just<br>
SS back, but take less time to aim, and your delay wins. Naturally<br>
the SS delay is better than any dual's delay.<br>
<br>
High damage: One of the most damaging SSes in the game, 400 vs<br>
almost anyone for a solid hit, 450-500 for a very good hit vs<br>
low defense bots and organics. Even turtle can take over 400<br>
from it.<br>
<br>
Giant pit: Not a big advantage but fun and sometimes useful. The<br>
SS makes a deep vertical hole. If you're lucky the enemy will end up<br>
in that hole. If a cake is on your team (or is your tag) you can<br>
suck an enemy into the hole and leave them with no angle or even<br>
bunged (on thin maps like adiumroot).<br>
<br>
Easy to use: You still neet a fairly precise hit, but you don't need<br>
to concentrate as hard with the SS as you do when using the other<br>
shots. The SS's vertical firing pattern means you can land the tracer<br>
on any part of the enemy and still do some damage, and the SS can be<br>
shotgunned when from right to left, unlike most other damaging SSes. It<br>
also doesn't have the strange hurricane properties of shot 1 or 2.<br>
If you can land the SS's tracer on the enemy when shooting through<br>
a hurricane, you can usually get full damage from it. That's much<br>
harder to do with shot 2.<br>
<br>
Disadvantages:<br>
<br>
Shot 1:<br>
<br>
- Useless if the enemy is far away and has land in front of them, the<br>
land blocks the shot 1's laser, which fires at a low flat angle.<br>
<br>
- Does not dig through land, is easily blocked by a pixel in front<br>
of you or in front of the enemy. A near miss does no damage also.<br>
<br>
Shot 2: <br>
<br>
- Quirky aiming means you must adapt your shot based on enemy's<br>
distance and your position (whether you're to their left or right).<br>
It's easy to miss half the lasers even when your tracer lands directly<br>
on the enemy.<br>
<br>
- At long range, your laser spread is so wide that half your shot will<br>
miss no matter how perfectly you place the shot. This limits long<br>
range damage potential if there's no weather effect or SS to help you.<br>
<br>
- Cannot always be shotgunned or easily aimed like direct hit shots.<br>
<br>
- Like shot 1, also has trouble with enemies who are far away and<br>
have some dirt in front of them. Your lasers come at the enemy at<br>
about 45 degrees no matter what angle you used to shoot your tracer.<br>
An enemy in a deep pit or with a wall of dirt in front can't be hit.<br>
<br>
- Often gets no benefit from force, and sometimes very little help<br>
from thor. Hurricane completely screws you over by making the shot<br>
twice as hard as any other mobile's hurricane shot. Lightning gives<br>
a nice damage bonus, but sometimes the first round of lasers and<br>
lightning bunges so much that a second shot from a dual will miss.<br>
<br>
SS: <br>
<br>
- No real disadvantage unless you're inside a hurricane and shoot<br>
a close enemy. The SS then tries to pass through the nado and some<br>
of it will usually miss.<br>
<br>

<br>
Deeper info:<br>
<br>
-Difference between shooting left and shooting right:<br>
<br>
Sate's Shot 2 lasers always rain down from left to right.<br>
This can affect how close the lasers come to the enemy's core<br>
and where you want to aim to get maximum damage. <br>
<br>
If Sate is on the left: Aim to place the tracer in the center of<br>
the enemy's body or, ideally, a tiny bit behind their center. <br>
You don't want to land the shot at their feet or try to shotgun.<br>
Shots that hit this way often do very low damage. Even an SS that<br>
is shotgunned at full power into the front of the enemy mobile will<br>
do less than half the usual damage.<br>
<br>
If Sate is on the right: Aim to place the tracer a bit in front<br>
of the enemy, like right at their feet. Because hitting their front<br>
is ideal, you can shotgun from right to left. Therefore whenever I<br>
am on the right side of the enemy, I try to do full power shotguns<br>
with shot 2 or otherwise fire with a very low angle (like 20). This<br>
gives lots of room for error on your shot's power control and makes<br>
nailing full 250+ damage quite easy. Being on the right owns if<br>
you're Sate. <br>
<br>
-Angle ruining: If you're close to the enemy and you see them in<br>
a vulnerable position (like they're using a steep hill to get<br>
angle) you can use shot 1 to ruin their angle. An even cooler trick<br>
is this: if you're on the right side, plant a shot 2 a bit in front of<br>
their feet, like half a mobile width. The shot will mostly miss,<br>
but the lasers will make a perfect vertical narrow hole and the<br>
enemy will take a bit of damage and drop into that hole. When<br>
they try to shoot again they will waste a turn shooting through a<br>
bit of dirt. Even when an enemy is already in a narrow hole<br>
like this, it's possible to land another shot 2 and KEEP them in a<br>
screwed situation with no angle. It's very demoralizing, especially<br>
for those with bad movement or low angles (it's great vs Nak, other<br>
Sate's, and Lightning). This trick can allow a Sate player with<br>
low health to beat an enemy with much more life by just constantly<br>
ruining his angle with carefully placed shot 2's. Remember it's<br>
from the right side only (didn't I say Sate is happy on the right?).<br>
If you're on the left, your shot 2 just sort of 'mows the lawn' by<br>
spraying horizontally across the dirt.<br>
<br>
-Far range: Already you know that Sate has to miss intentionally a<br>
little to get great damage from the lasers... that is, on the left<br>
side you want to miss behind them a tiny bit, and on the right you<br>
want to land the shot a tiny bit in front. When shooting far, you<br>
must increase the distance that you 'miss' your enemy by. That is,<br>
a shot from the left side must not only land behind the enemy, it<br>
must miss them totally hit land on the ground behind them. If you're on<br>
the right side, you have to make the shot land quite far in front of them,<br>
... the tracer never comes near them, but the lasers still smack them.<br>
<br>
-SS: When firing the SS, a center hit is pretty much always ideal.<br>
What's a little weird is that if you're on the left, you can't<br>
shotgun the SS (as you'd expect). If you're on the right, you CAN,<br>
but be careful. A close range, full power shotgun can sometimes<br>
send the SS tracer halway through their body so that it activates<br>
a bit past their center. Instead of a nice center hit, you get a<br>
crappy half-hit on their back side. So shotgunning the SS at full<br>
power is probably bad on either side. Just shoot with a normal amount<br>
of power while aiming directly at the enemy, and your SS will be OK.<br>
My strategy: Save the SS for difficult situations. Sate's shot 2 has<br>
some weaknesses with long range shots, hurricanes, and shooting<br>
enemies who are hiding behind a wall of dirt. The SS doesn't have<br>
any of these problems. Save it for these situations when <br>
a shot 2 just won't be good enough to do decent damage.<br>
The SS is also great for item lock weather, you can make an important<br>
shot for 400 damage while many of the other bots are stuck doing<br>
250 at most.<br>
<br>
-Hurricane: To hit through a hurricane, the tracer must land quit a<br>
bit behind the enemy. Then the lasers wrap around the tornado and<br>
hit an area in front of the tracer's landing place. You must<br>
control your power carefully and have some imagination to make 'nado<br>
shots with Sate. The more vertical the shot is, the closer your<br>
tracer should land to the enemy. E.g. for angle 80 you might want the<br>
tracer to land only 2 or 3 mobile widths behind the enemy. For a<br>
lower angle like 45, you might want to put it 1/4th of a screen or<br>
more behind the enemy. It also depends on the distance between you<br>
and the tornado. Try to imagine the lasers travelling from your<br>
Satellite high in the sky to the ground behind your enemy. If you can<br>
imagine a good nado shot, all you need to do is put the tracer in<br>
the right spot using your best feeling or formulas.<br>
It's a bit easier to hit a tornado shot using your shot 1. You may<br>
want to stick to shot 1 during tornados. One very strong trick is to<br>
fire a test shot with 1, then fire an SS through the 'nado. It looks<br>
pro but it's really easy - if the test shot tracer landed on the<br>
enemy, then an SS with the same angle and power will hit for good dmg.<br>
IMPORTANT: If you're sitting inside a hurricane, be very careful how<br>
close you try to plant your tracer. When shooting from inside a<br>
nado, your shot 2 will rain almost straight down and you can easily<br>
hit yourself.<br>
<br>
-Lightning: When there's lightning, it might be a good plan to use<br>
a powerup like duals. Sate gets a good damage bonus from lightning,<br>
better than almost anyone else does. Remember the slight bunge effect<br>
from your first shot when dualling, you might want to land the shot<br>
a little closer to you than usual to make up for the fact that<br>
the enemy will drop after the first hit. In other words, aim to hit<br>
their feet if shooting from the left side, and aim to hit a bit in<br>
front of their feet when shooting from the right side.<br>
<br>
-Thor: You can dual like anyone else when thor comes out.<br>
<br>
-Force: In order for force to affect your shot, both your tracer AND<br>
the laser must pass through the force. If the tracer passes through<br>
but the laser doesn't, then the damage is just normal. So you don't<br>
want to dual every time you see force, like most others would. The<br>
damage bonus is usually small.<br>
<br>
-Dual+: There's a bug with this, it happens often (not always).<br>
If you fire shot 2 first, the shot 2 will hit normally, but the<br>
followup shot 1 will just disappear and do no damage. If you fire<br>
shot 1 first, you will get both attacks and full damage. In general<br>
you always want to use shot 1 first with dual+ because the delay<br>
for the dual+ item is added to whatever shot you use with it.<br>
Doing shot 1 first therefore gets you lower delay as well as<br>
sure damage.<br>
<br>
-Dealing with angle fuxing: If you have no angle to shoot the enemy<br>
there are a few ways to deal with it: <br>
Dumb way: Fire shot 2 at the small bit of land blocking your shot.<br>
Then the lasers will blast away the land and also do a decent chunk<br>
of damage to you.<br>
Slightly smarter way: Fire shot 1 at the chunk of land, blowing it<br>
away without hurting yourself.<br>
Smartest way: Put Sate all the way under the small lip of land that's<br>
blocking your shot, then turn around and shoot behind you with either<br>
1 or 2 (depending on how much angle you need). This creates a sure<br>
angle for your next turn, and the land that was blocking your shot<br>
before might also help block the enemy's shot.<br>

<br>
Formulas:<br>
<br>
I mostly use fixed power shots with Sate. The simplest formula is<br>
like using the armor 2.4 method, but with Sate you will use 2.5 bars.<br>
The exact formula works like this:<br>
<br>
1. Measure the distance between you and the enemy. There are 30<br>
'distance units' to 1 screen. So an enemy who is half a screen away<br>
would be 15 distance units away from you. How to tell how far away<br>
they are? The easiest method is to right click and drag your screen<br>
so that you're at the edge of the screen (half on the screen, half<br>
off). If the enemy is positioned directly below the circular wind<br>
marker at the top of the screen, that's a half screen shot. If they're<br>
on the other side of the screen (half on and half off like you) then<br>
that's a 1 screen shot ... so that's 30 distance units.<br>
<br>
2. Starting at angle 90, lower your angle by the number of distance<br>
units between you and the enemy. For example, we know that an enemy<br>
half a screen away is 15 units away. So 90-15 = angle 75.<br>
<br>
3. Fire at 2.5 bars of power. If you're shooting from right to left,<br>
it can be helpful to reduce power a bit because that's the best<br>
way to get full damage on the enemy and ruin their angle.<br>
<br>
Some quick references - if you don't get this formula then just<br>
memorize these 4 simple rules.<br>
<br>
- Angle 80, 2.5 bars = 1/3 screen distance.<br>
- Angle 75, 2.5 bars = 1/2 screen distance.<br>
- Angle 70, 2.5 bars = 2/3 screen distance.<br>
- Angle 60, 2.5 bars = 1.0 screen distance.<br>
<br>
If an enemy is between these distances, just estimate how to change<br>
your angle as a result, for example if the enemy is about halfway<br>
between 2/3rds screen and 1 screen away... you know 2/3 screen is 70,<br>
and 1 screen is 60, so halfway between them is ... 65. So you'd use<br>
angle 65, 2.5 bars to hit that enemy.<br>
<br>
Wind adjustment:<br>
<br>
- Raise angle if wind is 'helping' your shot, i.e. blowing up or<br>
towards the enemy to carry the shot further.<br>
<br>
- Lower angle if wind is 'hindering' your shot, i.e. blowing down or<br>
against you to hold the shot back.<br>
<br>
How much to raise or lower your angle? You can use my windchart:<br>
<br>
<img src="windchart.jpg"></img><br>
<br>
Basically you divide the current wind strength by a certain number,<br>
and then raise or lower your angle by the result. The 'certain number'<br>
depends on the wind's direction and I give the math for it above.<br>
<br>
Other shooting info:<br>
<br>
-At full power<br>
84 = half screen distance<br>
78 = 1 screen distance.<br>
<br>
-Angle 8 or so is a 1 screen shotgun, so if you're on the left and<br>
an enemy is even with you and 1 screen away, fire at angle 8 with<br>
full power to hit them. If they're a bit above or below you can just<br>
change your angle a bit. If they're further away, raise your angle<br>
to compensate. Obviously nobody should be in between you<br>
and the enemy and you'll want to only try this from the right side,<br>
where shotgunning works for full damage.<br>
<br>
-If you have trouble shotgunning at full power, try a low angle<br>
like 20. With angle 20, the shot flies just high enough to pass over<br>
small hills like the kind you see in metamine or miramo town. At<br>
angle 20, half a screen is 1.6 bars and 1 screen is about 2.4 bars.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
General advice:<br>
<br>
-Don't high angle or use formulas on every shot just because you<br>
can. It's easier to plant your shot carefully with a simple angle<br>
between 40 and 60 degrees. Sate requires precision to get full damage.<br>
It's very hard to plant your shot precisely when using max power.<br>
<br>
-Watch delay, because nobody's better at stealing turns than Sate<br>
(except I guess boomer, mage, and the guys who use shot 1 always).<br>
<br>
-Take the easy, smart shot. What I mean is, for example, if the enemy<br>
is on land directly above you, don't try to hit the floor they're<br>
standing on, just drop the tracer anywhere below them (you can even<br>
use almost 0 power if you're sitting below them). Your lasers come <br>
from above always, so as long as the tracer lands directly below<br>
their center, the lasers will hit them for full damage. Also try to<br>
use the shot that will have the best chance of success. If the enemy<br>
is behind a tornado, don't dual with shot 2 unless you like to be<br>
hated. That kind of stunting is ok for pros who use armor but it's<br>
just too hard with Sate. Also keep in mind that if the enemy has<br>
dirt in front of them, you probably should try to drill with shot 2<br>
instead of trying to smack them with shot 1 (even if they have very<br>
little life left). Also watch for enemies who have a little hole<br>
under them. You can put the tracer into that hole even if you're<br>
far away and you'll still get full damage from your lasers.<br>
Let's say your teammate misses a bit in front of the enemy and<br>
makes a hole in the ground just in front of them. If you fire<br>
with too much power and your shot flies over, you get no<br>
damage. If you fire with just the right power, you get great damage.<br>
If you fire with too little power and your shot flies into the hole<br>
your teammate made, the tracer might still end up somewhere below the<br>
enemy, which means you might still get ok damage. So if you're worried<br>
about screwing up, remember that shooting with a bit less power is<br>
a safer shot than shooting with a bit too much.<br>
<br>
-Remember that if your angle is blocked when facing forwards, you<br>
can try moving to the back of the hole you're in and face the sky.<br>
You can sometimes get a good enough backwards angle this way to<br>
hit the enemy.<br>
<br>
-Don't blow off the left/right thing as being unimportant trivia.<br>
It really is important if you want to play Sate. You will be a much<br>
better player if you take advantage of the ability to shotgun from<br>
the right side and if you take care to overshoot a hair from the left.<br>
<br>
Ok, that's my Sate quikki guide. Go out and be pro with the bot all<br>
the other pros avoid.<br>
