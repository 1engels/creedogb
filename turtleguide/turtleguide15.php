<h1>Banpao (3 bar) formula</h1>
<hr>
<blockquote>
Banpao is a better formula than 2.4, but it's a little harder to use.
The power level is higher, so there's a larger distance
between angles, and that increases the chance of picking the wrong angle
or getting only a half-hit. It also means that if you get the power wrong,
the effect is greater.
<p>
With 2.4, you can get away with using just 1 windchart 
all the time. It's not perfect, but with experience
it can be good enough, and I try to show the exceptions to the rules.
The shots are low power so you 'feel' them a bit.
With banpao, you really must be more careful with wind adjusting. The more
power your shot has, the more airtime it will have the greater the wind's effect will be.
For example, if the math says to lower your angle by 8.5 degrees, and you
lower only 8, your 2.4 shot can still hit the front of the target. But with banpao,
being off by half an angle is enough to cause a complete miss.
<p>
Still, despite all of this, banpao is a very nice shooting system for Turtle. 
The power level is high enough to make shots beyond 
one screen (it works up to 1.5 screens). It also is nice 
because when you're deep in a pit, or the enemy is deep in a pit, you
will need to use a high angle shot to hit the target. Banpao uses higher angles
than 2.4 - for example a half screen shot is angle 80 instead of 75.
Some players say not to use 2.4 at all and just learn banpao. I think
2.4 is useful though and it's very similar to banpao. It's like a 'training
formula' to get you ready for banpao.

As you can see it's actually not unlike the 2.4 system. Your shooting
angles are still 90-60, but instead of using just enough power to cover 1 screen,
you use enough power to cover 1.5 screens. The power level is 'around' 3 bars,
which is why some people just call this the 3 bar formula.
<p>
It happens that 70, 3.0 bars covers 1 screen perfectly.
And 90 hits yourself. So as you might expect, half screen is
halfway between these... angle 80. As with the 2.4 system,
you use a little less power for close shots, and a little
more power for far shots. A close shot is under half screen 
(use 2.9 bars). For shots near 3/4 screen, use 2.95, and
for 1 screen and a bit past use 3.0 bars. At the maximum distance,
angle 60, you use 3.05. In 0 wind that will go 1.5 screens.

You can see I wrote in some shortcuts for measuring here.
If you're used to using 2.4, it might be difficult for you to
switch from measuring the screen in terms of 1/3rd or
1/6ths... to measuring 1 screen using 1/4ths. With banpao,
it's 20 angles per screen (90 to 70) and every 5 angles
will be 1/4th of a screen. So 85 is 1/4 screen, which can
be measured from the left side of the screen to the
middle of the shot 2 button. 80 is half screen, measured
the usual way. 75 is 3/4 screen, which can be a difficult
measurement. It's about 10 pixels past the 2nd mark
on your power bar. 70 is 1 screen, measured the usual way.
<p>
To measure past 1 screen needs a little trick. What I do is
first look to see where exactly 1 screen is. I lock my eyes
onto some part of the background (or if you're lucky, some
teammate/enemy) that is exactly 1 screen away from me.
Then I drag the screen so that whatever I locked onto
will be lined up with the left edge of my screen.
Then measuring is the same as before... the shot 2 button
will be 1.25 screens, and the middle of your first dual
will be 1 and 1/2 screens.
<p>
Once you get the 0 wind measurements, it's time for
the windcharts ^^. Banpao uses 3 charts, because high
powered shots are more sensitive to wind, and you can't
adjust an angle 60, 1.5 screen shot the same way you'd adjust
an angle 80, half screen shot.
