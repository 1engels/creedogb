<body><h1>LONG RANGE SHOTGUNNING</h1><br>
For any mobile, any distance.<br>
By CreeDo<br>
<br>
Formula:<br>
<b>Angle = (Distance from enemy in full power high angle parts) - 2.</b><br>
<br>
The formula relies on magic formula #5 (see<br>
the info I wrote on gunbound 'magic formulas' under<br>
"Stuff I've Written"). If you understand the next 2<br>
paragraphs, you can make your own shotgun formulas<br>
using 2, 3, or 4 bars<br>
<br>
Basically, that formula says that for any power level,<br>
a shot fired X angles below angle 45 will travel the<br>
same distance as a shot fired X angles above 45.<br>
So a full power shot fired at 30 angles over 45 (angle 75)<br>
will travel the same distance as a shot fired 30 angles<br>
under 45 (angle 15).<br>
<br>
Thinking of it another way, a shot fired at 90 - X<br>
angles will travel the same distance as shot fired<br>
at 0 + X angles. So if your full power 1 screen shot<br>
is 9 angles below 90 degrees (like boomer), then<br>
angle 9, full power should also travel 1 screen.<br>
Unfortunately, that formula doesn't work. I keep<br>
finding it's NOT accurate within 1 screen or less.<br>
It will almost always fly over the enemy's head<br>
if you calculate this way. I'm not sure why. It<br>
might be because your shot is coming from<br>
a little bit above your mobile, but your target is the<br>
center of the enemy mobile, not the air above them.<br>
<br>
The solution is to lower 2 or 3 angles (usually 2 is fine)<br>
to hit an enemy 1 screen away. For example, with Sate,<br>
a 1 screen full power high angle is angle 78, 12 angles below<br>
90. So you start with angle 12. Then you lower 2 angles.<br>
So a 1 screen shotgun for Sate is angle 10, not 12.<br>
Once you know to make this small 2 angle adjustment,<br>
you can hit shotguns at very long ranges with great accuracy.<br>
<br>
If you don't get it yet, here's a simpler explanation.<br>
<br>
1. If you already know your bot's full power high angle shots,<br>
measure how many parts there are between you and the target.<br>
For example, 1 screen for Armor and Turtle is angle 79. <br>
90-79 is 11, so it's 11 parts per screen roughly. So an enemy<br>
2 screens away is 22 parts away. It's actually 23 - the further<br>
your high angle shots have to travel, the smaller the distance<br>
is between each angle.<br>
<br>
2. The number of parts between you and the enemy = the<br>
angle you must fire at (using full power) to shotgun them, almost.<br>
So in the above example, 2 screen distances was 23 parts.<br>
Angle 23 is your basic angle... but don't forget:<br>
now lower 2 angles, for the reasons explained earlier.<br>
Your final angle should be 21 full to hit 2 screens away.<br>
<br>
Tips:<br>
<br>
* In short ranges, like inside 1 screen, it's easier to just<br>
'eyeball' the shot.<br>
<br>
* Height differences matter a lot for shotguns, you might<br>
both be on relatively flat ground on miramo town for<br>
example, but the hill you're on might be taller than the hill<br>
the enemy is on, so you'd need to shoot 2 or 3 angles lower<br>
to compensate.<br>
<br>
* Don't be stupid and clip a teammate who is sitting<br>
between you and your target. Your angle is so low you<br>
might not be able to clear the land or other mobiles<br>
in between you and the target.<br>
<br>
* Wind doesn't matter match, you only raise or lower<br>
by 1 or 2 angles usually. This is backwards from the<br>
usual wind adjustments you make when using high angles.<br>
When you shotgun, raising your angle makes<br>
the shot go further, so you <b>raise</b> angle when<br>
wind is down and against, and <b>lower angle</b> when<br>
wind is up and towards.<br>
<br>
* A bit of trivia, angle 14 full (almost 1 and 2/3 screens)<br>
is the minimum distance needed to do a shotgun boomer SS.<br>
<br>
* For nados I usually shoot about 3.5 bars (if the nado's<br>
in front of me) and do fine. For nados closer to the enemy, <br>
almost no adjustment is needed. You may need to raise 1<br>
angle.<br>
