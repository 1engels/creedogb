There's a useful power-substitution-formula that will allow you to use 
the banpao formula in upward wind.  It allows you to make long range shots 
in this difficult wind condition with more accuracy than guessing power
or attempting full power shots would.  Remember it's for perfectly upward
wind, if the wind is even a little bit forward or back the formula will
not work.
<p>
Basically the formula gives you a way to measure how much power to subtract
from the fixed power levels used in banpao shooting.  The original formula
was made by HongHong, but Talent on the feel forums tweaked it to come up
with something more accurate -
<p>
First measure your angle as you usually would with banpao, then do this math:<br>
1/2 SD POWER: 2.5 - [(wind-2)/30] +0.05<br>
1.0 SD POWER: 2.6 - [(wind-2)/30] +0.1<br>
<p>
The result will be a very small number, and this number will be how much
power you should subtract from  your shot in fractions of 1 bar.  For example:
<p>
<font color=#FFFF88>
Enemy is 3/4 screens away exactly.  Wind is 20 straight up.<br>
Normal banpao angle and power (in 0 wind) would be angle 75, 2.6 bars.<br>
Using the formula for 1sd, substitute the wind strength:<br>
2.6 -[(20-2)/30] +0.1<br>
First the easy part, we take care of 2.6 + 0.1 and get 2.7;<br>
Now it's 2.7 - [18/30]<br>
Dividing 18/30 gives us .6  ... so the math now is 2.7 - .6<br>
<b>final result:</b>
Angle 75, 2.1 bars will hit an enemy 3/4 screen distance in 20 wind straight up.
