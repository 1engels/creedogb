<body>I just made one with some fancy brackets by copying and pasting the character from the GB site's guild list, from other guilds using the symbol. So maybe that will work.<br>
<br>
Ok, I figured out how to do it. (I just made a new guild to test, but need to give it to a spare account)<br>
<br>
Do what Brenneh says, go to Guild > Guild List and then find guilds with the characters you want and copy/paste to your guild thing.<br>
<br>
To find the characters you want to type into the website to search, go here:<br>
<br>
http://www.kcrew.org/~shadzar/gbcharset.htm<br>
<br>
That lists ALL the symbols, so find the ones you like. Then, copy/paste that and type it into the Guild search on Guild list (you can't just copy/paste from Shadzar's, it'll say you can't use that type of symbol).<br>
<br>
Oh, and be sure to delete all spaces, and even without spaces, I had to redo my guild thing a few times before it worked. So if it doesn't work the first time, just keep trying and think of a new way.<br>
<br>
You can have up to 4 alt codes.<br>

You can thank me later >_>. <br><br>
