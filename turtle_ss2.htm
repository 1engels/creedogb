The second method of SSing involves shooting at high angles between 3 and 4 bars of power.
If you are familiar with how to aim high angles, then you already are halfway to learning
the high angle method with turtle's SS.  The basic idea is:<br>
1. Find a high angle shot that would land a little bit behind the enemy if you used
full power.<br>
2. Reduce your power by about 1cm (.2 or .25 bars, depending on their position) and
fire an SS on the next shot.<br>
<p>
If wind conditions are right (and the same as they were during your test shot) then the SS will explode at the highest point of its arc and then rain down in a tight cluster onto the target.  Done correctly this will yield 400-500+ damage.
As you get experienced with high angles etc, you will find you can do this without a test
shot.<br>

One of my favorite screenshots cuz of the text up top.  See the timer.  I take a long time
to calculate sometimes.  Anyway, to do this SS my calculation was simple and didn't need a
test shot.  I saw that the grub was a bit more than 3 'angles' away from the edge of the screen, i.e. if angle 79 full lands 1 screen away, angle 82 full would land in that little pit behind the crater grub is sitting in.  So I know I can hit grub with angle 82 'unfull'.
Instead of firing shot 2, I cut loose with an SS and use 1 cm less power than full.
This makes the shot land right on grub instead of a bit behind him.  Notice that
instead of using angle 82, I am using 83 because the wind is blowing a bit towards the grub.
You might be wondering "what if grub were at the 82 full position, would an 83 full SS work?
The answer is 'not really'.  For a high angle SS to give good damage it usually must open
at the very peak of the shot's arc, or very near the peak.  If you use full power, the shot
will actually open on the way up and then explode like fireworks and rain balls down
all over the screen.  To keep the balls tightly clustered, you really want 3.7 to 3.85
bars of power, at least in normal wind conditions where the wind doesn't blow the shot
upwards (which causes longer hangtime) or downward (which shortens the hangtime).

In this situation, I once again spot a position where my full power shot 1 or 2 will land a bit behind the enemy.  If I were to use an angle 87 shot (facing left) from this spot, it
would land behind the armor.  If I used angle 87 with less than full power I can hit the armor, so my SS shot in 0 wind would be 87, 3.8 bars of power. However wind is not 0 in 
this case, the wind is blowing 7 towards the armor.  So I need to raise my angle from 87
to 90... because 7/2 = ~3.  You'll notice from my power meter that I used closer to 3.6
bars of power, not 3.8.  That's because the wind is 7. If wind were 6, 3.8 bars would be
a good level of power to use, but because wind is 7... that level of power would cause the
shot to fly a bit too far.  So I reduce power a little more.  Unfortunately that means
the SS won't open at the perfect spot and the balls spread out a little.  the damage is 441.
That's good, but if wind had been 6 I could have used 3.7 or 3.8 bars of power and gotten 500+ damage out of the shot.

I can't hog all the screenshots.  My buddy here has the ideal situation: the enemy would be
be hit perfectly with 88 full power if the wind strength is only 2.  but the wind is 3, so
his high angle shot would land a bit behind the target.  So he fires an SS with 1 cm less
than full power, and it rains down for 500+ damage.  PRO!

One last picture.  This shows ramza's feeling system SS in action.  The idea is to fire a
test shot and use the sound effects as clues to tell you whether your test shot would make
a good SS or not.  You want to mentally count to three as the shot is fired... the
"tss" sound of the shot is 1.  As it's airborne, count to 2. Lastly you count to 3 and
if you hear the "splat" sound of your shot hitting immediately after.. you have the right
amount of airtime to make a good SS.
