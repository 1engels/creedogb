Credit to talent on the Lord forums for sharing these.
<p>
Also remember dselb's windchart for angle 70:
<a href="angle70.php">Boomer Set 70</a><br>
First guess the power you want to use in 0 wind. Then you multiply the wind
strength by the wind factor on dselb's chart to get a very small number,
then reduce your power by that small number.
<p>
If you have trouble controlling power with my the systems listed so far, there's another
lob system for close range shooting (up to 3/4 screen distance) that uses
exactly 2.0 bars of power, which is very easy to measure.
<p>
<table  border=0 cellspacing=0>
 <tr>  
  <td>1/4 SD</td> <td>Angle 81 (2.0 bars)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=type2>1/2 SD</td> <td class=type2>Angle 72 (2.0 bars)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=type3>3/4 SD</td> <td class=type3>Angle 62 (2.0 bars)</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
Lastly, I have an alternate lob system that can be used 1 screen and a bit further:
Boomer can use the banpao system (sometimes called 3 bar formula because
your power level will be close to 3 bars) to aim faraway shots.  It's 
best suited to 0 or low wind, like a normal lob.  There isn't much use for it
because boomer has well-documented high angle tricks using full power, and 
there isn't really any advantage to using around 3 bars instead of 4.  I guess
you could say this is for showing off.  Anyway, if you want to try it:
Power varies depending on how far the enemy is.
<p>
<table  border=0 cellspacing=0>
 <tr>  
  <td>1/2 SD</td> <td>Angle 80 (2.5 bars)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=type2>1.0 SD</td> <td class=type2>Angle 70 (2.7 bars)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td class=type3>1.5 SD</td> <td class=type3>Angle 60 (2.8 bars)</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>     
In between you must estimate for yourself.  Remember it's 10 angles to 
half a screen, therefore it's 5 angles for 1/4th of a screen.  5 angles
using this formula is about the same distance as 7 angles using the
1 screen lob formula (2.25 bars).  Power should also be adjusted.. for
example between 1/2 and 1.0 screen distances, 2.6 bars may be best.
<p>
Also check out this <a href="banpaopowersubstitution.php" name=other>Power Substitution Formula</a>
for the banpao shooting method. It will allow you to use the formula in 90 degree upward
winds.
